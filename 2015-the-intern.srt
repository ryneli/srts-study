1
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:13,272
Ben: Freud said, "love and work.
Work and love.

2
00:01:13,274 --> 00:01:15,074
That's all there is."

3
00:01:15,076 --> 00:01:18,043
Well, I'm retired,
and my wife is dead.

4
00:01:18,045 --> 00:01:22,247
As you can imagine, that's
given me some time on my hands.

5
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:24,183
My wife's been gone
for three and a half years.

6
00:01:24,185 --> 00:01:26,418
I miss her in every way.
And retirement?

7
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,555
That is an ongoing,
relentless effort in creativity.

8
00:01:29,557 --> 00:01:32,257
At first, I admit
i enjoyed the novelty of it.

9
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:34,059
Sort of felt like
i was playing hooky.

10
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:37,696
I used all the miles I'd saved
and traveled the globe.

11
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:40,232
The problem was, no matter where
i went, as soon as I got home,

12
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:42,901
the nowhere-to-be thing
hit me like a ton of bricks.

13
00:01:42,903 --> 00:01:46,105
I realized the key to this whole
deal was to keep moving.

14
00:01:46,107 --> 00:01:48,807
Get up, get out of the house,
and go somewhere.

15
00:01:48,809 --> 00:01:51,043
Anywhere.

16
00:01:51,045 --> 00:01:54,113
Come rain or shine,
I'm at my Starbucks by 7:15.

17
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:57,149
Excuse me,
mind if we join you?

18
00:01:57,151 --> 00:01:58,917
-No.
-Hey. How are you?

19
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:02,454
Can't explain it, but it makes
me feel part of something.

20
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:04,289
These guys today,
they're not numbers guys.

21
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,624
Don't talk figures
with them.

22
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:07,092
How do I spend
the rest of my days?

23
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:10,796
You name it.
Golf, books, movies, pinochle.

24
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:12,331
Tried yoga, learned to cook,

25
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,766
bought some plants,
took classes in mandarin.

26
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:17,469
<i> Xiang xin wo,</i>
<i> wo shen me dou shiguo le.</i>

27
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:20,239
Translation -- "believe me,
I've tried everything."

28
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:24,376
And then, of course,
there are the funerals.

29
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:30,682
So many more
than I could imagine.

30
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:32,918
The only traveling I do
these days

31
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,455
is out to San Diego
to visit my son and his family.

32
00:02:36,457 --> 00:02:39,124
They're great.
I love them to pieces.

33
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:41,293
But to be honest, I think
i probably relied on them

34
00:02:41,295 --> 00:02:43,195
way more than I should.

35
00:02:43,197 --> 00:02:45,764
Don't get me wrong,
I'm not an unhappy person.

36
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:47,633
Quite the contrary.

37
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:52,204
I just know there's a hole in
my life, and I need to fill it.

38
00:02:52,206 --> 00:02:54,173
Soon.

39
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,210
Which brings me to today
when I was leaving the market

40
00:02:58,212 --> 00:03:01,813
and caught your flyer
out of the corner of my eye.

41
00:03:01,815 --> 00:03:03,382
Hmm.

42
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:07,452
"Seniors, be an intern."

43
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:09,354
Ben,
i thought that was you.

44
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:10,355
Hi.

45
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:11,290
Hey.

46
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:13,058
What'd you find?

47
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,894
I think an Internet place
is looking for senior interns.

48
00:03:15,896 --> 00:03:17,863
-Am I reading this right?
-Let me see.

49
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:21,133
"Applicants must be
over 65 years of age...

50
00:03:21,135 --> 00:03:24,503
Have organizational skills, a
genuine interest in e-commerce,"

51
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:25,837
whatever that is...

52
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:27,839
"...and a roll-up-your-sleeves
attitude."

53
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:30,676
Aboutthefit.Com, isn't that
the outfit that was...

54
00:03:30,678 --> 00:03:32,144
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

55
00:03:32,146 --> 00:03:34,346
They bought one of those
old factories in red hook.

56
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:36,915
My daughter says they
sell clothes on the Internet.

57
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:39,084
How that works,
i have no idea.

58
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:41,553
Well, you have to
upload the application.

59
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,655
That could be challenging.
Listen to this --

60
00:03:43,657 --> 00:03:45,824
"cover letters
are so old-fashioned.

61
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:48,327
Show us who you are
with a cover-letter video.

62
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:51,663
Upload your video
to YouTube or vimeo using

63
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:55,567
.mov, .Avi,
or a .Mpg file.

64
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,669
We look forward to
meeting you."

65
00:03:57,671 --> 00:03:59,171
Well,
i guess that's meeting me.

66
00:03:59,173 --> 00:04:02,341
I swear I don't even know
what language that was.

67
00:04:02,343 --> 00:04:04,543
What are you doing tonight,
Ben?

68
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:06,778
-A frozen lasagna?
-Well...

69
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,948
I could make a little salad,
turn it into a dinner for two,

70
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:13,118
like we did that time
and never did again.

71
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,120
You know that was
over five months ago?

72
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:17,723
Oh, yeah. No, no, we got to
do that again, for sure,

73
00:04:17,725 --> 00:04:19,725
but okay
if we take a rain check?

74
00:04:19,727 --> 00:04:21,360
You're awful cute,
you know that?

75
00:04:21,362 --> 00:04:23,395
-No, I didn't.
-Well, it's true, you are.

76
00:04:23,397 --> 00:04:25,030
So I'll see you.

77
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,368
Don't take too long,
doll.

78
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,403
You're not
getting any younger.

79
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:34,406
-I know, I know, I know.
-All right.

80
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:59,131
So here I am, applying to be
one of your interns

81
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:00,899
because the more
i think about this idea,

82
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:02,901
the more tremendous
i think it is.

83
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:05,504
I love the idea of having
a place I can go every day.

84
00:05:05,506 --> 00:05:07,572
I want the connection,
the excitement.

85
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:08,940
I want to be challenged,

86
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:11,410
and I guess I might even
want to be needed.

87
00:05:11,412 --> 00:05:13,679
The tech stuff might
take a bit to figure out.

88
00:05:13,681 --> 00:05:15,347
I had to call
my 9-year-old grandson

89
00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:18,016
just to find out
what a USB connector was.

90
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:19,951
But I'll get there.
Eager to learn.

91
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:23,288
Also, I want you to know I've
been a company man all my life.

92
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:26,425
I'm loyal, I'm trustworthy,
and I'm good in a crisis.

93
00:05:26,427 --> 00:05:28,126
And I love that
you're right here in Brooklyn.

94
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:30,028
I've lived here all my life,
and lately I feel

95
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,830
I may not be hip enough
to live in Brooklyn,

96
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:34,166
so this could help with that,
too.

97
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:36,468
I read once,
musicians don't retire.

98
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,770
They stop when
there's no more music in them.

99
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:42,941
Well, I still have music in me,
absolutely positive about that.

100
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:14,740
Good news,
i found a size eight in Navy.

101
00:06:14,742 --> 00:06:17,676
No, you are right. That package
should have arrived by now.

102
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:19,144
Let me
track that for you.

103
00:06:19,146 --> 00:06:21,079
Yep, these pants are awesome
if you have hips.

104
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:22,481
Super slimming.

105
00:06:22,483 --> 00:06:24,649
Okay, let me just
review this with you --

106
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:26,551
you have six bridesmaids.
You ordered six

107
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,520
of the silk chiffon
antoinette dresses in pink.

108
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:30,222
The wedding
is in three days,

109
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:34,059
and the dresses just arrived
all in charcoal gray.

110
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:37,763
Which we don't even sell,
so that is a bit of a mystery.

111
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:39,698
Okay, here's what
we're gonna do about this.

112
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,933
I am gonna call the vendor
and have this fixed today.

113
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:44,536
I will personally see the
dresses before they are fedexed.

114
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:46,505
And I promise you
they will be at your front door

115
00:06:46,507 --> 00:06:48,673
by 9:00 A.M. Friday,
okay?

116
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:50,208
You know what, let me give you
my cell, just in case --

117
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:53,378
718-555-0199.

118
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,414
Oh, thank you so much
for your Patience.

119
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:57,616
And I am gonna refund you back
all your money.

120
00:06:57,618 --> 00:06:58,717
It's the--

121
00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:01,620
yes. N--

122
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:04,623
okay, hey, you check this one
off your list, okay?

123
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:05,924
This is done.

124
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:09,094
And, Rachel,
have a great wedding.

125
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:11,029
Oh, my god,
how did that happen?

126
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:12,364
Becky: Jules?

127
00:07:12,366 --> 00:07:13,698
I know, I know,
I'm late for something.

128
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,066
Yeah, everything.

129
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:16,568
You see why I take
customer-service calls?

130
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,203
I mean, it's so good.
You learn so much.

131
00:07:18,205 --> 00:07:19,905
Okay, what's up?
What am I doing?

132
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:21,740
Okay, Cameron was waiting for
you but had another meeting.

133
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:23,708
He said
he'll be back at 2:00.

134
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:26,211
Everyone needs you to sign off
on tomorrow's homepage.
Right.

135
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:28,046
And your 11:00 is in
the big conference room.

136
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:30,382
So is your 11:10.
Finance needs you,

137
00:07:30,384 --> 00:07:31,883
and I guess you
e-mailed a bunch of people

138
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:33,118
at 4:00 A.M.
about something?

139
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,820
Oh, good,
i forgot about that.

140
00:07:34,822 --> 00:07:36,788
I want to figure out a way for
friends to shop together online.

141
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,457
Make it less of
an alone thing.

142
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:40,625
E-mail me that idea,
will you?
Yeah, I like that.

143
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,294
Um, is now a good time
to call your mom back?

144
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:43,462
Dude, I'm on a bike.

145
00:07:43,464 --> 00:07:45,630
Happy birthday!

146
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:47,132
Come on.

147
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:49,901
Oh.

148
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:52,471
Oh, what a mess. This is
the middle of the office.

149
00:07:52,473 --> 00:07:54,272
Don't -- don't --
don't put that...

150
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,748
-Hello.
-Hi.

151
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,083
I'm Ben whittaker.

152
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:06,751
I received an e-mail
about an interview

153
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:08,420
for the senior intern
program.

154
00:08:08,422 --> 00:08:09,754
Hey, Ben.
How's it going?

155
00:08:09,756 --> 00:08:11,323
It's going good, real good.
Thank you.

156
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:13,024
Excellent.
Take a seat around the corner,

157
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:14,993
and someone from talent
acquisition will come get you.

158
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,295
Thank you.

159
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:19,030
"Talent acquisition"?

160
00:08:29,443 --> 00:08:30,842
Okay,
you guys have to remember,

161
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,544
the homepage
has to read in a glance.

162
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:34,379
-Right.
-Also, you have to
get back like this

163
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:36,848
if you want to see what looks
like if you're, like, over 35.

164
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,384
Okay,
so I can't read anything,

165
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:41,553
but if I could,
what do you want me to see?

166
00:08:41,555 --> 00:08:44,122
"Five girls, one shirt"
or "check out the fit"?

167
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:45,991
Well, both, but
what I really want you to see

168
00:08:45,993 --> 00:08:48,126
is the shirt worn by
five different body types.

169
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:49,961
Okay, then
you got to make me see that.

170
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:52,197
Try making the photo grid
bigger.

171
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:54,332
I love that five.
Can we make it more graphic?

172
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:55,667
Yeah, that's cool.

173
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:57,736
Maybe hero
the girl in the red shirt.

174
00:08:57,738 --> 00:08:59,070
-Jules...
-That is a great red.

175
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:00,739
It is going to
fly out of here.

176
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:03,174
I needed you to sign off
on this, like, two hours ago.

177
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:04,709
I know, I know,
but can you try?

178
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,044
Yep.

179
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,712
Mia?
Tell me that thing again.

180
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:10,882
Oh, 40% of our visitors
don't go past the homepage.

181
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,851
Which isn't so bad.

182
00:09:12,853 --> 00:09:14,252
Yeah,
but we should fix that.

183
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:15,854
Okay, here you go.

184
00:09:15,856 --> 00:09:17,022
I love it.

185
00:09:17,024 --> 00:09:18,323
Great, and it's up.

186
00:09:18,325 --> 00:09:19,991
Okay.
Thanks, everybody.

187
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:22,694
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

188
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:25,063
Employee: Let's go over
the pitch for Friday.

189
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,898
Okay, so...

190
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,166
The antoinette dress.

191
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:29,768
Major screw-up
by the vendor.

192
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:32,170
There's gonna be a couple of
interviews today, Ben.

193
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:35,040
We want to make sure that
we both find the right fit.

194
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:37,008
Business as usual
is not really our motto,

195
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,944
so we hope
you have some fun here.

196
00:09:38,946 --> 00:09:41,580
This is the first time we're
hiring senior interns,

197
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:42,881
so some of
our intern questions

198
00:09:42,883 --> 00:09:44,583
may not exactly fit
your profile,

199
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:46,518
but we're gonna go for it
anyway, okay?

200
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,619
Fire away.

201
00:09:47,621 --> 00:09:48,720
Okay, good.

202
00:09:48,722 --> 00:09:50,121
Where'd you go to school?

203
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:51,523
I went to Northwestern.

204
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:53,458
Hey, my brother
went to Northwestern.

205
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,093
Probably not
at the same time.

206
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:57,562
Probably not.
He graduated in 2009.

207
00:09:57,564 --> 00:09:59,297
Class of '65.

208
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:01,299
Wow,
what was your major?

209
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:03,034
Do you remember?

210
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:07,272
And after Northwestern
you went on to...?

211
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:08,740
I went to work
for Dex one.

212
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:11,376
Okay, and they made...?
Phonebooks.

213
00:10:11,378 --> 00:10:12,777
I was in charge of
overseeing

214
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,412
the printing
of the physical phonebook.

215
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:16,214
I did that for over 20 years,
and before that,

216
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:18,149
I was their
v.P. Of sales and advertising.

217
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:20,418
So, do they still
make phonebooks?

218
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,754
I mean, doesn't everyone
just Google numbers?

219
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:24,823
I believe they do,
but before Google that
was how you got a number.

220
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:26,825
Oh, no, no.
Yeah, I -- I get it.

221
00:10:26,827 --> 00:10:28,460
So 40 years
at the phonebook company?

222
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:30,495
That is amazing,
seriously.

223
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:32,097
Okay, Benjamin.

224
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:34,165
Now, I'm gonna ask you one of
our more telling questions

225
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:35,900
for all of our interns,
so I want you to, like,

226
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:37,502
this is the one
to really think about, okay?

227
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:39,337
And --
and take your time.

228
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:41,373
Where do you see yourself
in 10 years?

229
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:44,275
When I'm 80?

230
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:46,144
Yeah, sure.

231
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,145
Yeah, whatever.

232
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,913
Um...

233
00:10:48,915 --> 00:10:50,849
Wait.
Did not realize you were 70.

234
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:53,485
That's, uh -- that question just
doesn't work for you, does it?

235
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:55,353
Should we just scratch that one
and just move on?

236
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:57,689
-It's your call, Justin.
-Okay, that one's gone.

237
00:10:57,691 --> 00:10:59,190
You look great, by the way.
So great.

238
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:01,159
And you're clearly more than
qualified for this job.

239
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:02,527
You're actually, like,
way overqualified,

240
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:03,762
and we were so impressed.

241
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:05,764
You had great interviews,
great video.

242
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:07,699
You nailed it, Ben.
Congrats.

243
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:09,167
You're an intern.

244
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:10,535
-Hey.
-Hi.

245
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:12,003
I need you for two minutes,
uninterrupted.

246
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,371
-Okay.
-Remember a few weeks ago,

247
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:14,973
we talked about
the senior intern program?

248
00:11:14,975 --> 00:11:16,675
-No.
-Really? We had a --

249
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:18,543
we had a whole, big conversation
about it.

250
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:20,011
We did?
Okay, remind me.

251
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,346
Seniors in high school
or college?

252
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:22,480
No, no, no, no.

253
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:24,783
Seniors in life.
Older people.

254
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:26,384
Hold on, what?

255
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:28,620
I told you I felt like we needed
to do an outreach program.

256
00:11:28,622 --> 00:11:30,488
You definitely seemed to be
liking the idea,

257
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,290
so I set it in motion.
It's gonna be great.

258
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:33,725
Hold, please.

259
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:35,994
You're hiring
senior citizen interns?

260
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:37,629
There's been
a ton of research on this,

261
00:11:37,631 --> 00:11:40,298
and the results
are actually incredible.

262
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,068
I mean, imagine having an intern
with a lifetime of experience,

263
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,569
as opposed to
somebody who spent

264
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:46,371
the last four years of their
life playing beer pong.

265
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:48,073
Do they eventually
want jobs here?

266
00:11:48,075 --> 00:11:49,908
No, darling,
they're all retired.

267
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,910
They -- they just want
the experience.

268
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:54,846
And I would like one
to work directly with you.

269
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:57,015
Wait, Cameron, no.

270
00:11:57,017 --> 00:11:59,250
First of all,
I'm not great with older people.

271
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:01,052
You know how I am
with my parents.

272
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,754
This could be...

273
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:04,055
Why do i
have to have one?

274
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,690
Because you have to
set the tone.

275
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:08,059
Now, would you prefer
a man or a woman?

276
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,195
There's a great
72-year-old woman, really cute.

277
00:12:10,197 --> 00:12:11,763
That's like the same age
as my mom.

278
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:13,264
-That's too weird.
-That's fine.

279
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:15,166
There's a man everyone loves.
He seems amazing.

280
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:17,001
I watched his video
with the whole group.

281
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:19,571
People were crying.

282
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:21,740
Okay, this is not going to work,
in my opinion.

283
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:23,842
But how long
do I have to do this for?

284
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:26,778
-Minimum?
-Six weeks or we'll be sued.

285
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,280
I know we never
talked about this.

286
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:31,182
Yeah, we did.
For real.

287
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:32,917
He starts tomorrow.

288
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:48,433
Mm.

289
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,976
Back in action.

290
00:12:57,978 --> 00:13:00,545
Thank god.

291
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:03,214
Jason:
New interns, welcome to atf.

292
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:05,583
We all work on this one floor,
and that is because

293
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:08,753
we are all about
communication and teamwork.

294
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:10,221
No one
has a private office,

295
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:12,624
not even our founder and ceo,
Jules ostin,

296
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:15,894
who is actually
right over there.

297
00:13:15,896 --> 00:13:18,329
She loves to ride her bike
through the office.

298
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:20,331
That woman does not
like to waste time.

299
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,300
Plus,
she counts it as exercise.

300
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,002
That's adorable.

301
00:13:24,004 --> 00:13:25,837
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

302
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,072
Hey. How you doing?
I'm Davis.

303
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:29,440
Hi, Davis.
Ben whittaker.

304
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:31,476
-Exciting place, huh?
-Oh, my god.

305
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:34,145
They had one opening for a
regular-age intern, no offense.

306
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,314
I got it.
I'm so psyched.

307
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:37,582
I'm pretty psyched
myself.

308
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:39,450
All right,
a few words about Jules.

309
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:41,619
She started about the fit
only 18 months ago.

310
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:43,621
This whole idea was hatched
at Jules' kitchen table

311
00:13:43,623 --> 00:13:44,956
right here in Brooklyn.

312
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,457
Jules tried everything on
that she sold,

313
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:47,525
described the fit herself,

314
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:50,261
and apparently it worked.

315
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:52,530
She was online
in four months.

316
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:54,799
She started with 25 employees.

317
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:56,434
She's now up to 216.

318
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:58,169
With you 4, 220.

319
00:13:58,171 --> 00:13:59,704
Wow.

320
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:01,539
Hey, Ben, are you gonna
wear a suit every day?

321
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,675
-You bet.
-Confident.

322
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:05,009
I like how you roll.

323
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:07,011
I like it a lot.

324
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:13,218
We just hit a record high
of 2,500 likes on instagram.

325
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,353
Yeah!

326
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:19,057
And that's what we do

327
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:20,792
when something good
happens around here.

328
00:14:20,794 --> 00:14:22,293
New interns, grab a seat

329
00:14:22,295 --> 00:14:24,062
at one of the intern tables
over there.

330
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:26,197
Check your e-mail. You may find
that you've been assigned

331
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:29,033
to one particular person
or one particular team.

332
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:30,368
Or you might just be
a floater.

333
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,836
It's all good.

334
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:34,405
Okay,
let me instagram this.

335
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:36,007
Moment in time.

336
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:38,176
Gray is the new green.

337
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:39,244
Take a seat.

338
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,359
Thanks.

339
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:33,064
Got one.

340
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:35,767
Cameron:<i> "Welcome Ben!</i>
<i> Your internship will be</i>

341
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:38,269
<i> directly with our founder,</i>
<i> Jules ostin."</i>

342
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,939
Oh,
I'm in the photo studio.

343
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:42,974
Floater.
Love!

344
00:15:42,976 --> 00:15:44,475
Hey, Ben,
what'd you get?

345
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:46,444
Looks like I'm gonna be
a personal intern.

346
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:47,946
Nice. To?

347
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:49,213
Jules ostin.

348
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:51,182
Unfortunate.

349
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:53,751
Hang in there.

350
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,091
Becky:<i> "Hi Ben,</i>
<i> I have secured an appointment</i>

351
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:02,961
<i> for you to meet with</i>
<i> Jules ostin today at 3:55 P.M.</i>

352
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:06,397
<i> Please be prompt as Jules has</i>
<i> another meeting at 4:00 P.M."</i>

353
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,667
Hmm.

354
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:12,603
All right,
I'm going to merchandising.

355
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:13,905
Beautiful.

356
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,756
It's perfect.

357
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:33,591
Yes, I'll try to
have her there at 5:00.

358
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:35,193
Um, no, wait.

359
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:36,995
I booked her with a vendor
at 5:15.

360
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:38,796
I'm sorry.

361
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:40,598
I'll call you back.

362
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,933
Yes, hello?

363
00:16:41,935 --> 00:16:43,368
Hi.
I'm Ben whittaker.

364
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:45,770
I have a 3:55 appointment
with Ms. ostin.

365
00:16:45,772 --> 00:16:47,271
3:55?

366
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:49,040
I thought she was meeting with
her new intern.

367
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:50,775
That's me.

368
00:16:50,777 --> 00:16:52,844
How you doing?

369
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:55,046
I'm sorry, uh,
how are you an intern?

370
00:16:55,048 --> 00:16:57,615
W-- it's the new
senior intern program.

371
00:16:57,617 --> 00:16:59,484
It just started today.

372
00:16:59,486 --> 00:17:00,718
Oh, my god.

373
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,453
Um...

374
00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:03,554
How old are you?

375
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:05,490
70. You?

376
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:06,724
I'm 24.

377
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:07,825
I know, I look older.

378
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:08,960
It's the job.
It ages you.

379
00:17:08,962 --> 00:17:10,962
Which won't be great
in your case.

380
00:17:10,964 --> 00:17:12,330
Sorry.

381
00:17:12,332 --> 00:17:14,065
I actually thought
you looked younger.

382
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:16,000
Yeah, right.

383
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:18,970
Any tips
before I go in?

384
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:22,240
Just talk fast.
She hates slow talkers.

385
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:24,042
Maybe that's just
when I talk slow.

386
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:25,977
Don't dawdle in any way.
Just keep it moving.

387
00:17:25,979 --> 00:17:28,346
And don't forget
to blink.

388
00:17:28,348 --> 00:17:29,881
-Blink?
-Yeah.

389
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:31,916
She hates when people don't
blink. It weirds her out.

390
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:33,684
But it's 3:57.
This meeting that she's in

391
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:36,187
just took up like two of your
f-- they're out. Go, go, go.

392
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:38,056
-Okay, thanks.
-Go. Yeah.

393
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:39,090
What?

394
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:40,358
Oh, yeah, I'm here.

395
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,860
Hi, Jules?

396
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:45,229
I'm Ben,
your new intern.

397
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:47,365
I'm glad you also
see the humor in this.

398
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:49,600
Be hard not to.

399
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:52,103
So, Ben...

400
00:17:52,105 --> 00:17:54,572
I was gonna say
what is a nice guy like you

401
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:55,773
doing at
a place like this?

402
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:57,542
But Cameron
gave me the drill,

403
00:17:57,544 --> 00:17:58,876
so can I just
be honest with you?

404
00:17:58,878 --> 00:18:00,178
Please.

405
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,946
I'm not gonna have
a lot for you to do.

406
00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:03,381
That's the truth.

407
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:06,017
And you being assigned to me
is kind of just

408
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:08,719
for me to set an example
for the rest of the team.

409
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:11,722
If you ask me, I think
that you'd be much better off

410
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:13,124
working in creative
or marketing.

411
00:18:13,126 --> 00:18:14,459
It's a little bit
slower pace,

412
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:16,060
maybe a little bit
easier to grasp.

413
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:18,229
If you requested to transfer,
we can make that happen.

414
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:20,064
If that's
what you'd prefer.

415
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:24,035
You'll be happier, believe me.
I am not so fun to work for.

416
00:18:24,037 --> 00:18:27,038
That's what I gather,
but I can get along with anyone,

417
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,873
and I'm here to
learn about your world,

418
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,708
give help where I can,
so...

419
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:33,044
So,
you don't want to transfer?

420
00:18:33,046 --> 00:18:34,278
Not really, sir.

421
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,447
I'm terribly sorry.

422
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:37,915
Excuse me.

423
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:39,250
Okay.

424
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:40,985
Well, then, looks like
you're stuck with me.

425
00:18:40,987 --> 00:18:42,787
Great, I'm excited.

426
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:46,657
I will e-mail you when
i have something for you to do.

427
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:49,460
Or I could just stop by
a few times a day, check in...?

428
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:50,928
I'll e-mail you.

429
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,231
Also, don't feel like
you have to dress up.

430
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:54,732
I mean,
we're super cas here.

431
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:57,735
Well, I'm comfortable in a suit,
if it's okay.

432
00:18:57,737 --> 00:18:59,470
No, it's fine.

433
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:00,505
Old school.

434
00:19:00,507 --> 00:19:01,839
Exactly.

435
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:03,407
At least
I'll stand out.

436
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:05,443
I don't think you need a suit
to do that.

437
00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:07,645
True.

438
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,948
Well, I think we did it
in less than two minutes.

439
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,817
I'll wait to
hear from you.

440
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,185
Okay.

441
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:18,756
Want the door
open or closed?

442
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:20,024
Doesn't matter.

443
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:23,427
Open, actually.

444
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:27,698
You'll get used to me.

445
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,433
Look forward to it.

446
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:43,514
Hi.

447
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,349
Hi.

448
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,218
Hi.

449
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,786
Hi.

450
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:50,521
Howdy.

451
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:51,822
What do you need?

452
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:54,025
No.

453
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:02,300
What's up, Ben?
Are you good?

454
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:03,868
Perfect.

455
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,570
Okay.

456
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:14,879
The v-neck back tee?

457
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:15,980
This is Holly.

458
00:20:15,982 --> 00:20:17,315
Can you
run that up to them?

459
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:19,150
Yeah, no, no, we love
the whole line, mark.

460
00:20:19,152 --> 00:20:20,651
Lewis:
Okay, so you can zoom out.

461
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:22,253
-Like that.
-I'm going to a meeting.

462
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:23,988
I'll be back in an hour.
We'll talk then?

463
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,823
And then you can just
click here to buy it.

464
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:28,159
Cool, yeah.

465
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,004
Hello?

466
00:20:40,006 --> 00:20:41,505
Hi, yeah.

467
00:20:41,507 --> 00:20:43,207
All right.

468
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:44,875
You staying?

469
00:20:44,877 --> 00:20:46,777
Can't leave
before the boss leaves, Davis.

470
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:48,512
Looks like
you're gonna be here a while.

471
00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:50,848
All right.
See you in the morning, Ben.

472
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,416
Have a good night.

473
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:54,485
You, too.

474
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:06,764
Let's make it happen.

475
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,433
Thanks.

476
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,474
How about I push,
you deliver?

477
00:21:16,476 --> 00:21:18,376
Thank you.

478
00:21:18,378 --> 00:21:21,212
I like that there's four faves
instead of three,

479
00:21:21,214 --> 00:21:23,281
but can I see the one
without the jacket just to...

480
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:24,315
Sure.

481
00:21:24,317 --> 00:21:25,549
Hi.

482
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:28,886
Okay, so they want to know

483
00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:30,388
what customers bought
who didn't come back

484
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:31,922
so they can spot a problem
if there is one, right?

485
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:33,391
Yeah, but
i don't understand how to--

486
00:21:33,393 --> 00:21:34,792
all right, well, here's
what I think we should do.

487
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:36,060
-Ben!
-We should go--

488
00:21:36,062 --> 00:21:37,895
Ben! Hey, look.
Here she comes.

489
00:21:37,897 --> 00:21:39,096
Watch how
she won't even--

490
00:21:39,098 --> 00:21:40,231
hey, Beck.
What's up?

491
00:21:40,233 --> 00:21:42,833
You look
really nice to--

492
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:46,170
how long can a woman
be mad at you for?

493
00:21:46,172 --> 00:21:48,139
Well, it kind of
depends on what you did.

494
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:50,608
Well, first of all,
nothing on purpose.

495
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,109
We were going out
for a minute.

496
00:21:52,111 --> 00:21:54,745
I thought she was cool.
I really liked her.

497
00:21:54,747 --> 00:21:57,915
But then I sort of
accidentally...

498
00:21:57,917 --> 00:21:59,950
-Slept with her roommate.
-That doesn't help.

499
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:01,285
I didn't know
she was her roommate.

500
00:22:01,287 --> 00:22:02,920
I met her out.
How would I know that?

501
00:22:02,922 --> 00:22:05,156
-Hey, Nikki.
-Ben, tell me.

502
00:22:05,158 --> 00:22:06,324
I don't know this stuff.

503
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:07,758
You're older.

504
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,427
You've been through
a lot.

505
00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:12,363
I mean, you -- I mean,
you have a lot of experience.

506
00:22:12,365 --> 00:22:14,131
How long do you think
she'll be mad at me for?

507
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:15,933
Jay, I have zero experience
with women,

508
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:18,035
and I can tell you, there's
no coming back from that one.

509
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:20,171
I mean, I assume
you talked to her, apologized,

510
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:21,939
told her
how much she means to you.

511
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:24,208
Well, you know...

512
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:25,543
You didn't talk to her?

513
00:22:25,545 --> 00:22:26,977
What did you do,
send her a tweet?

514
00:22:26,979 --> 00:22:28,312
No, of course not.

515
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:30,981
I, like, texted her
a billion times.

516
00:22:30,983 --> 00:22:33,884
She didn't answer,
so then I e-mailed her.

517
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:35,486
But it was like,
a nice e-mail.

518
00:22:35,488 --> 00:22:37,288
It was a long one,
well thought out.

519
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:39,123
Subject line I wrote,
"I'm sooorry,"

520
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:40,558
with like a ton of o's.

521
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,293
So it was like,
"I'm sooorry,"

522
00:22:42,295 --> 00:22:46,030
with a sad emoticon
where he's crying

523
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:48,733
at the side of
its little cheek.

524
00:22:48,735 --> 00:22:51,502
I should probably actually
just talk to her, huh?

525
00:22:51,504 --> 00:22:52,737
Obviously.

526
00:22:52,739 --> 00:22:54,905
Can't imagine
it would hurt.

527
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:56,807
Oh, did yesterday's numbers
come in?

528
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:58,576
Yeah.

529
00:22:58,578 --> 00:23:00,077
We could do it that way,
too.

530
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:02,179
I noticed my intern
sure keeps busy.

531
00:23:02,181 --> 00:23:03,514
Mr. congeniality.

532
00:23:03,516 --> 00:23:04,815
He's a very big hit.

533
00:23:04,817 --> 00:23:06,083
Everybody loves him.

534
00:23:06,085 --> 00:23:07,818
Okay,
do not look at that desk.

535
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,053
It's like
the office junk drawer.

536
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:11,322
It's just gonna
drive you crazy.

537
00:23:11,324 --> 00:23:12,656
You just did that.

538
00:23:12,658 --> 00:23:14,392
What, are you
preparing for surgery?

539
00:23:14,394 --> 00:23:17,595
Okay, seriously?

540
00:23:17,597 --> 00:23:20,398
Like,
how did this even happen?

541
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:30,674
No, no, i-i can set it up.

542
00:23:30,676 --> 00:23:32,176
She's just in a meeting.

543
00:23:32,178 --> 00:23:33,744
Hi.
Something I can help you with?

544
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:35,746
Yes, Jules spilled soy sauce
on her Saint Laurent jacket.

545
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:37,181
Can you take it
to the photo studio?

546
00:23:37,183 --> 00:23:38,616
There's lots of cleaners
and stuff in there.

547
00:23:38,618 --> 00:23:39,617
Sure.
Where is it?

548
00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:41,118
She's wearing it.

549
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:46,290
They would like us
to consider the possibility...

550
00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:47,792
Okay.

551
00:23:47,794 --> 00:23:52,696
...of, uh, meeting with
some, uh, potential CEOs.

552
00:23:52,698 --> 00:23:54,398
Wow.

553
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,235
I did not
see that coming.

554
00:23:58,237 --> 00:24:01,605
W-why? Uh...

555
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:03,541
Am I too inexperienced
at running a business?

556
00:24:03,543 --> 00:24:04,975
I-i didn't go to Harvard?

557
00:24:04,977 --> 00:24:07,812
My -- my methods
aren't by the book?

558
00:24:07,814 --> 00:24:11,315
I mean,
isn't that how we got here?

559
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:12,950
Really?

560
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:14,885
I need adult supervision?

561
00:24:14,887 --> 00:24:17,388
Could we be doing better?

562
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:20,090
We hit our five-year goal
in nine months.

563
00:24:20,092 --> 00:24:21,559
Exactly.

564
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:23,561
Jules, we can't keep up
with our own success.

565
00:24:23,563 --> 00:24:25,229
You know that.

566
00:24:25,231 --> 00:24:27,598
You're an hour late
to every meeting.

567
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,900
We have a name for it --
Jules standard time.

568
00:24:29,902 --> 00:24:32,570
And look, I get it. There's only
so many hours in the day.

569
00:24:32,572 --> 00:24:34,271
We're all playing catchup.

570
00:24:34,273 --> 00:24:37,007
Our tech guys work until
2:00, 3:00 in the morning.

571
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:39,076
Customer service
is slammed.

572
00:24:39,078 --> 00:24:40,578
We're running out of
inventory.

573
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:43,180
We've got shipping issues
and programming problems.

574
00:24:43,182 --> 00:24:44,515
And -- and the bigger we get,

575
00:24:44,517 --> 00:24:46,183
the more complicated
it's gonna get.

576
00:24:46,185 --> 00:24:48,152
But isn't this
what a startup is?

577
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:50,454
What?

578
00:24:50,456 --> 00:24:52,690
Say it. What is everyone
so worried about?

579
00:24:52,692 --> 00:24:55,826
That it's all going too fast,
and it could get away from us.

580
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:58,996
Our investors just think
that a seasoned ceo

581
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:00,965
could take some things
off your plate.

582
00:25:00,967 --> 00:25:03,667
That's all. Just free you up
to do what you do great.

583
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:05,135
You come up with the ideas,

584
00:25:05,137 --> 00:25:06,937
and let somebody else
make the trains run on time.

585
00:25:06,939 --> 00:25:08,539
But, Cameron,
this new person,

586
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:10,508
they are going to
want to do things their way.

587
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,176
Technically
be my boss.

588
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:14,678
I mean,
how can I do what I do

589
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,547
if I have to
report to someone else,

590
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:18,782
run every idea I have
by this person?

591
00:25:18,784 --> 00:25:20,217
Can you
see that working?

592
00:25:20,219 --> 00:25:22,319
Well,
gilt groupe brought in a ceo.

593
00:25:22,321 --> 00:25:24,088
How are they doing?

594
00:25:26,224 --> 00:25:28,993
I mean, get me ceo lessons,
you know?

595
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:33,330
Ben: Uh, excuse me.

596
00:25:33,332 --> 00:25:35,299
I apologize,

597
00:25:35,301 --> 00:25:38,035
but Becky said you needed
something taken care of

598
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:39,904
on your jacket.

599
00:25:39,906 --> 00:25:42,039
Oh, right.

600
00:25:52,183 --> 00:25:53,317
Thank you, Ben.

601
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:54,952
Of course.

602
00:25:57,088 --> 00:26:00,824
The v.C.S made up a list
of potential CEOs.

603
00:26:00,826 --> 00:26:02,660
Let's just take a look
at the list.

604
00:26:02,662 --> 00:26:05,329
Explore it,
then decide.

605
00:26:05,331 --> 00:26:07,064
Baby steps.

606
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:12,670
Ben.

607
00:26:12,672 --> 00:26:14,238
Something big
going on in there?

608
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,606
I couldn't say.

609
00:26:15,608 --> 00:26:17,241
You were in there
a long time.

610
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:18,943
I can't hear a thing.

611
00:26:18,945 --> 00:26:21,111
Psst!

612
00:26:21,113 --> 00:26:22,947
Say something
about me to her.

613
00:26:22,949 --> 00:26:25,449
No, you have to do it.

614
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:30,220
On my way, boss.

615
00:26:30,222 --> 00:26:31,689
Hmm. Boss.

616
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:49,306
Hey, Ben. Ben.

617
00:26:49,308 --> 00:26:50,808
How old's
that briefcase?

618
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:53,944
It's a 1973 executive ashburn
attaché.

619
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:55,546
They don't make it anymore.

620
00:26:55,548 --> 00:26:57,147
I'm a little
in love with it.

621
00:26:57,149 --> 00:26:59,350
It's a classic, Lewis.
It's unbeatable.

622
00:27:02,253 --> 00:27:03,754
Good night.

623
00:27:03,756 --> 00:27:05,222
Bye.

624
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:29,013
Jules: Oh, my god.
Somebody cleaned up that desk.

625
00:27:29,015 --> 00:27:33,317
I swear, I was gonna stay late
and do this myself.

626
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:35,119
Wasn't me.

627
00:27:35,121 --> 00:27:37,421
Ben came in at 7:00 this morning
and did it.

628
00:27:37,423 --> 00:27:38,822
Who?

629
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:39,923
Ben.

630
00:27:39,925 --> 00:27:41,859
Your intern.

631
00:27:41,861 --> 00:27:44,128
Ben whittaker.

632
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:46,797
Someone's very happy.

633
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,033
Brilliant.
Thank you.

634
00:27:49,035 --> 00:27:51,235
Best thing that's happened
around here all week.

635
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,613
Thank you.

636
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,220
This is your gift
for a job well done.

637
00:28:10,222 --> 00:28:13,791
I'm Fiona,
the house masseuse.

638
00:28:13,793 --> 00:28:15,192
Hi, Fiona.

639
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:16,326
-Hi.
-Ben.

640
00:28:16,328 --> 00:28:17,795
Hi.
Does that feel okay?

641
00:28:17,797 --> 00:28:19,363
It feels great, actually.
Thank you.

642
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:21,565
Okay. You're a little bit tight,
Ben.

643
00:28:21,567 --> 00:28:23,067
Well, I haven't sat at a desk
for a while.

644
00:28:23,069 --> 00:28:25,402
-My body's not used to it.
-No, I get it.

645
00:28:25,404 --> 00:28:28,539
Plus, they say
sitting is the new smoking.

646
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:30,240
Let me see
what I can do.

647
00:28:30,242 --> 00:28:32,643
I, uh, spotted you
in the lunchroom.

648
00:28:32,645 --> 00:28:33,977
I wondered who you were.

649
00:28:33,979 --> 00:28:35,312
-Did you? Oh.
-Yeah.

650
00:28:35,314 --> 00:28:37,247
Then someone told me
you were an intern.

651
00:28:37,249 --> 00:28:39,249
That's pretty cool of you
to do this.

652
00:28:39,251 --> 00:28:41,151
Well, it's a brave new world.
Thought I'd jump in.

653
00:28:41,153 --> 00:28:42,319
See what it's all about.

654
00:28:42,321 --> 00:28:45,055
Yeah, I know.
Absolutely.

655
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:48,058
I'm constantly amazed
at what they do here.

656
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,693
Love being
a part of it.

657
00:28:49,695 --> 00:28:51,228
Oh.

658
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,930
-Oh, my god.
-Yeah.

659
00:28:52,932 --> 00:28:55,833
There. Yeah.
Right there.

660
00:28:55,835 --> 00:28:57,835
How's that, Ben?

661
00:28:57,837 --> 00:29:00,370
Well, it's -- oh, boy.

662
00:29:00,372 --> 00:29:01,905
Good.

663
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:04,341
Jason.

664
00:29:04,343 --> 00:29:06,777
Okay, good.
Good, good.

665
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,280
There, good.

666
00:29:10,282 --> 00:29:12,583
Here you go.

667
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:14,451
A little tight
right here.

668
00:29:14,453 --> 00:29:15,686
Is that better?

669
00:29:15,688 --> 00:29:17,755
-Oh, boy, oh, boy.
-Oh, how's that?

670
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:20,224
Oh, boy.

671
00:29:20,226 --> 00:29:22,526
Well, it was nice to meet you,
Ben.

672
00:29:22,528 --> 00:29:25,062
Love that there's another
oldie but goodie here.

673
00:29:25,064 --> 00:29:26,597
Nice to meet you.

674
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:27,631
See you later?

675
00:29:27,633 --> 00:29:28,699
Love to.

676
00:29:28,701 --> 00:29:30,200
Me, too.

677
00:29:35,975 --> 00:29:37,708
You're not as old
as I thought you were.

678
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:39,143
Ooh!

679
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:43,480
Wait, so you're saying
you shave every day?

680
00:29:43,482 --> 00:29:45,048
-Yes.
-Even on Sundays?

681
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:47,718
-Every day.
-Okay, and even if you know

682
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,286
that you're not gonna see
anyone that you know?

683
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:51,622
-Yes.
-How is this possible?

684
00:29:51,624 --> 00:29:53,290
I'm on
cheapapartments.Com,

685
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:55,793
and I literally can't afford
a single apartment

686
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:57,327
in all of Brooklyn.

687
00:29:57,329 --> 00:30:00,097
My parents gave me two weeks
to find a place,

688
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:02,099
and that's just not
gonna happen.

689
00:30:02,101 --> 00:30:03,433
Getting evicted?

690
00:30:03,435 --> 00:30:05,969
Hey, I'm in no rush,
but apparently they are.

691
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:09,473
All right, here.
Let me see your phone.

692
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:11,909
Cheapapartments.Com.
Have you tried craigslist?

693
00:30:11,911 --> 00:30:15,045
-Yes.
-Okay. Then I am out of ideas.

694
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:25,255
Jules. Hi.
How are you?

695
00:30:25,257 --> 00:30:27,024
Hi. How are you?

696
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,099
-Hey.
-Hey.

697
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:37,768
-How's it going?
-Well, good.

698
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:39,970
-Mike, right?
-Yeah.

699
00:30:39,972 --> 00:30:41,872
Yeah, I'm Ben.
I work for Jules.

700
00:30:41,874 --> 00:30:43,607
Yeah, she'll be down
in a minute.
I know.

701
00:30:43,609 --> 00:30:45,342
Look, I don't want to make you
feel uncomfortable,

702
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:47,277
but I just happen to have
looked out the window,

703
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,779
and it appeared
you were drinking something

704
00:30:48,781 --> 00:30:50,681
from a paper bag.

705
00:30:50,683 --> 00:30:52,716
I don't know
what you're talking about, man.

706
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:56,286
Why don't you tell her
you can't drive her today,

707
00:30:56,288 --> 00:30:57,955
or I'm gonna have to.

708
00:31:01,726 --> 00:31:03,227
We all good?

709
00:31:03,229 --> 00:31:04,728
Yeah.

710
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:16,506
Jules,
I'm sorry to do this,

711
00:31:16,508 --> 00:31:19,042
but I'm actually
not feeling so hot.

712
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:20,377
Not sure
i should be driving.

713
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:21,378
I wouldn't want to
give you anything.

714
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,746
Oh, sure.

715
00:31:22,748 --> 00:31:23,981
Yeah, no, you should
take the day off

716
00:31:23,983 --> 00:31:25,215
and feel better, okay?

717
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:26,917
Thanks.

718
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:31,655
I'm happy
to cover for Mike.

719
00:31:31,657 --> 00:31:33,690
That's okay.
Becky can drive me.

720
00:31:33,692 --> 00:31:35,726
Really?
You want to give her more to do?

721
00:31:40,598 --> 00:31:42,900
I hope you don't mind
if I don't get in the front.

722
00:31:42,902 --> 00:31:45,269
I-I'm not trying to be rude.
I just think better in the back.

723
00:31:45,271 --> 00:31:46,436
I mean, I could
get in the front, but --

724
00:31:46,438 --> 00:31:48,372
no, no, no.
This is perfect.

725
00:31:48,374 --> 00:31:49,506
Yeah.

726
00:31:52,845 --> 00:31:55,345
And everything you hear in the
car is strictly confidential.

727
00:31:55,347 --> 00:31:57,214
-Okay?
-Goes without saying.

728
00:31:57,216 --> 00:31:59,249
-Hi, mom.
-Oh, I found you.

729
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:01,785
Yeah. So, what's up?
How's everything?

730
00:32:01,787 --> 00:32:03,720
Well, your dad and i
are finally putting together

731
00:32:03,722 --> 00:32:05,522
all our research
at the hospital.

732
00:32:05,524 --> 00:32:06,556
That's great.

733
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:08,959
I hear you typing.

734
00:32:08,961 --> 00:32:10,394
That's better.

735
00:32:10,396 --> 00:32:12,129
So, we've been studying
women under 40

736
00:32:12,131 --> 00:32:14,131
who sleep less than
six hours a night.

737
00:32:14,133 --> 00:32:16,533
-And what'd you find out?
-It's interesting.

738
00:32:16,535 --> 00:32:18,602
It seems like
they're 38% more likely

739
00:32:18,604 --> 00:32:20,270
to experience major weight gain

740
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:22,572
compared to women who slept
seven hours a night.

741
00:32:22,574 --> 00:32:23,974
Are you kidding me?

742
00:32:23,976 --> 00:32:25,709
You know I haven't slept
in two years.

743
00:32:25,711 --> 00:32:27,978
Well, I can't change
the facts, dear.

744
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:30,814
Mom, you know what?
I'm rushing into the city for
a meeting and I need to prepare.

745
00:32:30,816 --> 00:32:32,716
Can I call you
when I get home?

746
00:32:32,718 --> 00:32:34,451
Oh, you don't have to.

747
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:36,420
Okay. Love you.

748
00:32:36,422 --> 00:32:38,055
Thank you.

749
00:32:42,328 --> 00:32:43,727
Hey, how we doing?

750
00:32:43,729 --> 00:32:45,629
Did you look over
the material on atwood?

751
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:47,164
Yeah, I did.

752
00:32:47,166 --> 00:32:49,766
Uh, he had a great run at
travelocity and citigroup...

753
00:32:49,768 --> 00:32:51,301
And I get it.
He's major.

754
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:53,403
He is.
And the best thing about him

755
00:32:53,405 --> 00:32:56,106
is he's been watching us,
and he loves what we're doing.

756
00:32:56,108 --> 00:32:57,507
But he's only one of the names
on the list.

757
00:32:57,509 --> 00:32:59,242
So if you don't like him,
we move on.

758
00:32:59,244 --> 00:33:02,079
But, Jules,
try to be open.

759
00:33:02,081 --> 00:33:03,280
He's supposed to
be brilliant.

760
00:33:03,282 --> 00:33:05,482
And the v.C.S love him.
A lot.

761
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:07,484
Mark Zuckerberg
never brought in a ceo,

762
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:09,252
and he was a teenager.

763
00:33:09,254 --> 00:33:10,754
Call me after.

764
00:33:10,756 --> 00:33:12,823
Okay.

765
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:16,293
Oh, thanks,
but you don't have to.

766
00:33:16,295 --> 00:33:18,028
-I can open the door.
-Sure.

767
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:20,430
Okay, so, this shouldn't
take more than an hour.

768
00:33:20,432 --> 00:33:21,798
But if you can't stay here,

769
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,533
I'll call Becky
and then she'll find you.

770
00:33:23,535 --> 00:33:24,668
And then
you can just pull up --

771
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,937
don't worry.
I'll be here.

772
00:33:26,939 --> 00:33:29,439
I think
i forgot to eat today.

773
00:33:29,441 --> 00:33:31,375
Should I pick you up
some Sushi?

774
00:33:31,377 --> 00:33:33,610
No,
i eat too much Mercury.

775
00:33:33,612 --> 00:33:35,212
I'll be fine.
I'm good.

776
00:33:35,214 --> 00:33:37,014
I'm actually kind of nauseous,
so...

777
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:11,314
That was fast.

778
00:34:11,316 --> 00:34:12,883
Not fast enough.

779
00:34:12,885 --> 00:34:15,485
Oh, i-i picked you up some soup
from a place I know.

780
00:34:15,487 --> 00:34:16,753
Thanks.

781
00:34:16,755 --> 00:34:19,890
You really didn't have to d--
to do --

782
00:34:19,892 --> 00:34:21,858
oh, my god,
that smells so good.

783
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,093
Good.

784
00:34:26,498 --> 00:34:28,598
Word travels fast.

785
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,100
Pretty short meeting.

786
00:34:30,102 --> 00:34:32,269
-Yeah. I hated him.
-Really? What happened?

787
00:34:32,271 --> 00:34:35,172
I thought he was
a condescending,
sexist know-it-all

788
00:34:35,174 --> 00:34:37,374
who did not seem to get
what we do at all.

789
00:34:37,376 --> 00:34:39,776
And, honestly, I think
he would run our business

790
00:34:39,778 --> 00:34:42,012
in a completely inorganic way
that would lose us

791
00:34:42,014 --> 00:34:44,781
all the customers
we have killed ourselves to get.

792
00:34:44,783 --> 00:34:46,850
Oh, and I think
that he would replace us

793
00:34:46,852 --> 00:34:48,251
as soon as
he got the chance.

794
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:49,519
Oh, and...

795
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:52,522
The man never blinked.

796
00:34:52,524 --> 00:34:54,558
An olympian non-blinker.

797
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,393
Okay, then.

798
00:34:56,395 --> 00:34:57,727
Yeah.

799
00:34:57,729 --> 00:34:59,930
See you in the A.M.?

800
00:34:59,932 --> 00:35:02,866
Be there or be square.

801
00:35:02,868 --> 00:35:04,301
I'm sorry.

802
00:35:04,303 --> 00:35:06,369
Hey, don't be.

803
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:31,928
I just wanted to say thank you
for helping out with Mike today

804
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:33,563
and for
getting me chicken soup.

805
00:35:33,565 --> 00:35:36,900
Oh, and for cleaning that mess.
That was awesome.

806
00:35:36,902 --> 00:35:38,268
Seriously.

807
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:40,036
You're very welcome.

808
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,142
It's okay.
I really won't bite.

809
00:35:45,144 --> 00:35:48,812
You started this business all by
yourself a year and a half ago,

810
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:51,148
and now you have
a staff of 220 people.

811
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,916
Remember who did that.

812
00:35:52,918 --> 00:35:54,117
Who?

813
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:58,321
Um, thank you.

814
00:35:58,323 --> 00:36:01,391
And I hate to say it,
but try to get some sleep.

815
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:06,263
-Mommy.
-Hey!

816
00:36:06,265 --> 00:36:07,364
Hi.

817
00:36:07,366 --> 00:36:09,799
-Hi.
-Here's my favorite girl.

818
00:36:09,801 --> 00:36:12,802
Hey, baby.

819
00:36:12,804 --> 00:36:14,271
-Hi, honey.
-Hey.

820
00:36:15,606 --> 00:36:17,507
Over the hump.

821
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:21,111
So, how was your day?

822
00:36:21,113 --> 00:36:22,879
Kind of okay.
But you know what?

823
00:36:22,881 --> 00:36:25,615
Maddie said she didn't want to
be my friend anymore.

824
00:36:25,617 --> 00:36:27,050
Oh.

825
00:36:27,052 --> 00:36:28,718
You know what?
I don't think she meant it.

826
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,554
She'd miss you too much.

827
00:36:30,556 --> 00:36:34,357
I'm starting to think
that maddie is bipolar.

828
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:36,626
We go through this
every other day.

829
00:36:36,628 --> 00:36:37,994
We do.

830
00:36:37,996 --> 00:36:40,297
Oh, how was your meeting?
It was today, right?

831
00:36:40,299 --> 00:36:42,132
Yeah, just had it.

832
00:36:42,134 --> 00:36:44,334
Mommy, I think I'm winning.
Look!

833
00:36:44,336 --> 00:36:46,303
Oh, that is so cool.

834
00:36:46,305 --> 00:36:48,672
Yeah, that's
the play-doh cake challenge.

835
00:36:48,674 --> 00:36:50,240
We're not finishing
until tomorrow,

836
00:36:50,242 --> 00:36:52,542
so please hold
on all judging.

837
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:55,078
Not to mention that we had
an accident with mine

838
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:58,548
when someone, not to name
any names, put her elbow in it.

839
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,750
-What?
-It was an accident.

840
00:37:00,752 --> 00:37:03,687
Well, I got to say,
i love the pink one a lot.

841
00:37:03,689 --> 00:37:06,056
That's mine.
Are you happy at me?

842
00:37:06,058 --> 00:37:09,492
I am so happy at you.
I'm beyond happy at you.

843
00:37:09,494 --> 00:37:11,494
Daddy helped me
with the icing.

844
00:37:11,496 --> 00:37:13,096
Good job, you guys.

845
00:37:13,098 --> 00:37:14,831
So, how about
i give you your bath, okay?

846
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:16,199
Wait, hang on.
I was waiting for your call.

847
00:37:16,201 --> 00:37:18,268
So,
you didn't like the guy?

848
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:20,704
He wasn't
a good fit for me.

849
00:37:20,706 --> 00:37:23,907
But a lot of other names
on the list, so...

850
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:25,075
Yeah.

851
00:37:25,077 --> 00:37:26,876
I'm gonna
beat you upstairs.

852
00:37:35,354 --> 00:37:37,287
Miles:<i> Ben,</i>
<i> I haven't seen you in days.</i>

853
00:37:37,289 --> 00:37:39,456
That's right, homey.
Ben's got a job.

854
00:37:39,458 --> 00:37:41,524
Patty:
<i> Oh, you're never home.</i>

855
00:37:41,526 --> 00:37:44,894
<i> What do you do--</i>
<i> never mind. It's Patty.</i>

856
00:38:02,147 --> 00:38:03,280
Hello?

857
00:38:03,282 --> 00:38:05,115
Hi, uh, Fiona.

858
00:38:05,117 --> 00:38:07,450
It's Ben whittaker
from about the fit.

859
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:10,153
Oh, hey.
It's good to hear your voice.

860
00:38:10,155 --> 00:38:11,921
Oh, it's good
to hear your voice, too.

861
00:38:11,923 --> 00:38:14,157
It was great
meeting you today.

862
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:16,493
I called you quicker
than you thought I would.

863
00:38:16,495 --> 00:38:18,361
I'm glad you did.

864
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:30,073
Jules.

865
00:38:30,075 --> 00:38:32,976
Shh.
Let her sleep, dad.

866
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:35,078
Okay.

867
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,847
Okay.

868
00:38:41,952 --> 00:38:43,820
<i> When I heard that,</i>
<i> I was like, "good,</i>

869
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:46,156
<i> because I definitely wasn't</i>
<i> eating lunchables before."</i>

870
00:38:48,794 --> 00:38:50,627
<i> Yeah, they're coming out with</i>

871
00:38:50,629 --> 00:38:52,662
<i> a more grown-up version</i>
<i> of lunchables.</i>

872
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:54,931
<i> Uh, they're called</i>
<i> so you still can't cook-ables.</i>

873
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:58,435
<i> Uh, grow-up-ables already.</i>

874
00:39:06,043 --> 00:39:07,711
I tried to stay up.

875
00:39:07,713 --> 00:39:09,512
I know.

876
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:12,549
I'm sorry I fell asleep
in there. I just passed out.

877
00:39:12,551 --> 00:39:15,785
I know we had a plan to have
a grown-up conversation.

878
00:39:15,787 --> 00:39:18,588
You want to
netflix something?

879
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,796
Hm?

880
00:39:26,798 --> 00:39:29,332
I'm sorry.
I just fell out for a second.

881
00:39:29,334 --> 00:39:31,634
It's okay.

882
00:39:31,636 --> 00:39:34,070
Paige learned to say
"humongous" today.

883
00:39:34,072 --> 00:39:35,305
Really?

884
00:39:35,307 --> 00:39:36,840
Cracks me up.

885
00:39:36,842 --> 00:39:38,875
She looks at me,
she says,

886
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:42,312
"you're a very humongous dad,
dad."

887
00:39:42,314 --> 00:39:43,313
Oh.

888
00:39:45,417 --> 00:39:49,386
Oh, god. You know I hate
to sound like the other moms.

889
00:39:49,388 --> 00:39:51,988
But I'm starting to feel like
i need a little me time.

890
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:54,758
I know.

891
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:03,233
Good night.

892
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:12,442
Anybody home?

893
00:40:12,444 --> 00:40:15,445
Can't keep my eyes open,
jule.

894
00:40:15,447 --> 00:40:17,013
We'll do it tomorrow,
okay?

895
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:33,530
Can you turn out
your light?

896
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:52,081
Hello?

897
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:53,583
Hey, Ben.
It's Becky.

898
00:40:53,585 --> 00:40:55,051
From Jules' office?

899
00:40:55,053 --> 00:40:56,386
Yeah, hey.
What's up?

900
00:40:56,388 --> 00:40:57,654
Jules' driver is m.I.A.

901
00:40:57,656 --> 00:40:58,955
He's not answering
any of my texts.

902
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:00,657
I know
you drove Jules yesterday,

903
00:41:00,659 --> 00:41:02,125
and I didn't hear
any complaints.

904
00:41:02,127 --> 00:41:03,560
So can you pick her up
this morning?

905
00:41:03,562 --> 00:41:05,728
-Sure.
-You know where she lives?

906
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:08,498
-I was there yesterday.
-Okay, so you remember.

907
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,266
-Yeah.
-And you're hearing me, right?

908
00:41:10,268 --> 00:41:12,001
Loud and clear, boss.

909
00:41:12,003 --> 00:41:14,304
Okay, so be there at 7:45,
ring the bell, and walk away.

910
00:41:14,306 --> 00:41:15,438
She'll know it's you.

911
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,073
Ring bell, walk away.
Got it.

912
00:41:22,414 --> 00:41:24,714
Oh, walk away.

913
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,917
Hang on.
I'm coming.

914
00:41:27,919 --> 00:41:29,352
Hi. Here for Jules?

915
00:41:29,354 --> 00:41:30,987
Yeah, hi, sorry.
I'll wait in the car.

916
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:33,289
Uh, she's on a call.
Do you want to come in?

917
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:34,757
I just made some coffee.

918
00:41:34,759 --> 00:41:35,925
Could be a while.

919
00:41:35,927 --> 00:41:37,193
I'm Matt.

920
00:41:38,863 --> 00:41:40,096
Ben whittaker.

921
00:41:40,098 --> 00:41:41,698
Good to meet you.
Come on in.

922
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:44,100
Legos everywhere,
so watch your step.

923
00:41:44,102 --> 00:41:45,635
Sure.

924
00:41:45,637 --> 00:41:48,104
Jules: Maybe feature some
bloggers on the homepage?

925
00:41:48,106 --> 00:41:49,973
Have a seat, Ben.

926
00:41:49,975 --> 00:41:51,875
Hey, Paige, this is Ben.
He works with mommy.

927
00:41:51,877 --> 00:41:53,176
-Hi.
-Hi.

928
00:41:53,178 --> 00:41:54,978
I'm playing
Princess memory game.

929
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:57,614
Oh, yeah.
Looks like you're about to win.

930
00:41:57,616 --> 00:41:59,148
So,
your Jules' new driver?

931
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:01,284
No, actually,
I'm her intern.

932
00:42:01,286 --> 00:42:03,553
That's hysterical.

933
00:42:03,555 --> 00:42:05,655
You know
what an intern is?
No.

934
00:42:05,657 --> 00:42:07,457
That's okay.
Everyone thinks it's hysterical.

935
00:42:07,459 --> 00:42:10,193
Hey, Matt, did a--

936
00:42:10,195 --> 00:42:11,961
morning.

937
00:42:11,963 --> 00:42:14,564
Morning.

938
00:42:14,566 --> 00:42:16,733
Is that all
dry-cleaning?

939
00:42:16,735 --> 00:42:19,035
These three are.
These two are laundry.

940
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:21,471
And this button --
this button is missing.

941
00:42:21,473 --> 00:42:23,039
I mean, it's loose, so...

942
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:24,073
-Okay.
-If they could just...

943
00:42:24,075 --> 00:42:25,475
-You got it.
-Thanks.

944
00:42:25,477 --> 00:42:26,743
Hey, and, honey,
uh, before you leave,

945
00:42:26,745 --> 00:42:27,911
just got to
go over a couple things.

946
00:42:27,913 --> 00:42:29,245
Okay.

947
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:31,581
-Look who I found.
-Yay!

948
00:42:31,583 --> 00:42:33,983
-He was in your hamper.
-Thank you.

949
00:42:33,985 --> 00:42:35,652
Matty,
did an atf box arrive for me?

950
00:42:35,654 --> 00:42:37,153
On the table.

951
00:42:37,155 --> 00:42:39,155
Uh, I -- I think
I'll just wait -- wait out--

952
00:42:39,157 --> 00:42:42,325
Ben.
Do you want a raisin?

953
00:42:42,327 --> 00:42:44,160
- Thank you.

954
00:42:44,162 --> 00:42:46,896
Okay, so tonight,
you're working...

955
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:49,032
Are you listening,
or did I lose you?

956
00:42:49,034 --> 00:42:50,099
Ben,
is she listening?

957
00:42:50,101 --> 00:42:51,701
I am totally listening.

958
00:42:51,703 --> 00:42:53,903
I ordered some stuff
to check on how it arrived.

959
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:55,905
Not great,
by the way.

960
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:57,173
Go on.
Tonight?

961
00:42:57,175 --> 00:42:58,908
Yeah, okay.
You're working,

962
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:01,711
so Paige and I are gonna
go to my mom's for dinner.

963
00:43:01,713 --> 00:43:03,746
After school's
Ruby's birthday party.

964
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:05,615
And, uh,
what about next Monday?

965
00:43:05,617 --> 00:43:07,550
Do you know yet if we can go to
dinner with Robbie and Annie?

966
00:43:07,552 --> 00:43:10,119
Oh,
I'm so slammed next week.

967
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,690
I'm sorry.
If you want to go, I'll make it.

968
00:43:13,692 --> 00:43:16,359
-When was it?
-Oh, my god. Monday.

969
00:43:17,962 --> 00:43:20,530
Okay, I'm sorry. I was fixated
on this tissue paper.

970
00:43:20,532 --> 00:43:21,764
I will be there.

971
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:23,466
Okay.

972
00:43:23,468 --> 00:43:26,402
Thank you for the coffee.
Thanks for letting me play.

973
00:43:26,404 --> 00:43:27,570
Oh! Sorry.

974
00:43:27,572 --> 00:43:28,938
I'll meet you in the car.

975
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:31,240
Actually, I have to go.
Come on, sweetie.

976
00:43:31,242 --> 00:43:32,575
Ben, we're gonna
drop Paige at school, okay?

977
00:43:32,577 --> 00:43:34,077
-Here we go.
-Let's do it.

978
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:37,046
Kiss daddy goodbye.
Mwah!

979
00:43:37,048 --> 00:43:40,249
Hey, wait.
You forgot your doggy.

980
00:43:44,388 --> 00:43:46,255
Matt seems like
a terrific guy.

981
00:43:46,257 --> 00:43:48,958
Hmm?
Sorry,
didn't mean to interrupt.

982
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,561
Uh, that's okay.
I agree. He is.

983
00:43:51,563 --> 00:43:53,162
Who? The dad?

984
00:43:53,164 --> 00:43:55,298
That's what the other kids
call Matt

985
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:58,101
because he's the only dad
in a sea of moms.

986
00:43:58,103 --> 00:43:59,669
I've read about
these househusbands.

987
00:43:59,671 --> 00:44:01,571
It's interesting
how that all worked just now.

988
00:44:01,573 --> 00:44:04,741
They actually prefer to be
called stay-at-home dads.

989
00:44:04,743 --> 00:44:06,676
Oh, sorry.
Did not know that.

990
00:44:06,678 --> 00:44:08,645
Well,
it's very admirable.

991
00:44:08,647 --> 00:44:10,613
He's a real
21st-century father.

992
00:44:10,615 --> 00:44:11,981
He is.

993
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:13,916
He actually
had a great job in marketing,

994
00:44:13,918 --> 00:44:15,952
but, um,
when about the fit took off,

995
00:44:15,954 --> 00:44:18,521
he left
to be a full-time dad.

996
00:44:18,523 --> 00:44:21,090
Totally saved our butts.

997
00:44:33,971 --> 00:44:35,872
Oh, we're here,
big girl.

998
00:44:35,874 --> 00:44:38,374
I do this in the cafeteria

999
00:44:38,376 --> 00:44:41,544
to my lunch friends
when they're don't looking.

1000
00:44:41,546 --> 00:44:43,312
-You do that?
-Hey, Jules.

1001
00:44:43,314 --> 00:44:45,448
Hi.
Nice to see you here.

1002
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:46,949
Uh, not sure
if you got our e-mail,

1003
00:44:46,951 --> 00:44:48,818
but we're doing a fiesta lunch
next Friday,

1004
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:50,787
and we thought
you could bring the guacamole.

1005
00:44:50,789 --> 00:44:53,790
Uh, you probably won't have time
to make it, so you can buy it.

1006
00:44:53,792 --> 00:44:55,491
Which is fine.

1007
00:44:55,493 --> 00:44:57,560
Enough for 18.

1008
00:44:57,562 --> 00:44:59,228
No, I can make it.
It's not a problem.

1009
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:01,130
Great.
Matt can bring it.

1010
00:45:01,132 --> 00:45:02,165
Totally.

1011
00:45:02,167 --> 00:45:04,200
Bye.

1012
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:07,003
All right.
Have a great day, sweet pea.

1013
00:45:07,005 --> 00:45:08,571
Have fun at Ruby's party,
okay?

1014
00:45:08,573 --> 00:45:11,841
Mommy? Do you know how
to make guacamole?

1015
00:45:11,843 --> 00:45:13,543
Yes, I do.
Really well, in fact.

1016
00:45:13,545 --> 00:45:15,311
We're --
we're gonna make it together.

1017
00:45:15,313 --> 00:45:17,346
And after that, we'll have
a mother-daughter dance party?

1018
00:45:19,651 --> 00:45:21,617
Hey, maddie.
What's up?

1019
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:26,355
Bipolar.

1020
00:45:26,357 --> 00:45:27,924
Oh, my god.

1021
00:45:27,926 --> 00:45:29,225
Come here.

1022
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:30,526
Oh, I love you,
big girl.

1023
00:45:30,528 --> 00:45:32,061
I love you, too.

1024
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:34,697
God.

1025
00:45:34,699 --> 00:45:37,100
Taking the high road
is exhausting.

1026
00:45:37,102 --> 00:45:38,935
It's 2015.

1027
00:45:38,937 --> 00:45:41,037
Are we really still critical
of working moms?

1028
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:43,673
Seriously? Still?

1029
00:45:43,675 --> 00:45:47,076
I'm sorry.
That was all rhetorical.

1030
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:48,544
There's no need
to respond.

1031
00:45:48,546 --> 00:45:50,079
Wasn't going to.

1032
00:46:07,131 --> 00:46:08,598
Oh, Ben.

1033
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,099
I want to
stop by the warehouse.

1034
00:46:10,101 --> 00:46:11,701
480 greenpoint.

1035
00:46:11,703 --> 00:46:12,935
Sure.

1036
00:46:14,371 --> 00:46:16,539
No, no, no, no.
You want to make a right.

1037
00:46:16,541 --> 00:46:18,441
9th to Hamilton
to the expressway.

1038
00:46:18,443 --> 00:46:21,444
Uh, I think we should take
4th to flatbush. Much faster.

1039
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:24,113
I-it won't be.

1040
00:46:24,115 --> 00:46:26,115
By 12 minutes, at least.

1041
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:27,483
Can I try?

1042
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:31,621
I apologize.

1043
00:46:31,623 --> 00:46:33,556
No need.

1044
00:46:33,558 --> 00:46:37,593
Jules: Try to line the dots up
the best you can.

1045
00:46:37,595 --> 00:46:39,295
And then...

1046
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:40,763
Okay.

1047
00:46:40,765 --> 00:46:43,599
If you can,
try to pull this towards you,

1048
00:46:43,601 --> 00:46:44,667
holding it on the outside.

1049
00:46:44,669 --> 00:46:46,903
Good meeting you.

1050
00:46:51,775 --> 00:46:53,476
Okay, so then
put that on lightly.

1051
00:46:53,478 --> 00:46:55,478
Put it down with two.
Secure it.

1052
00:46:58,515 --> 00:46:59,982
Our package should feel like
they're getting

1053
00:46:59,984 --> 00:47:02,084
a little gift
that they bought for themselves.

1054
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:12,829
It's open.

1055
00:47:12,831 --> 00:47:13,930
Ben.

1056
00:47:13,932 --> 00:47:15,531
-Wow.
-Come on in.

1057
00:47:15,533 --> 00:47:17,533
-Didn't expect this.
-Yeah.

1058
00:47:17,535 --> 00:47:20,136
I like to think of it
as a little bit of paradise.

1059
00:47:20,138 --> 00:47:22,839
Can I interest you
in a back rub?
Oh, no, thanks.

1060
00:47:22,841 --> 00:47:25,374
I just came by because
i found out I have to work late.

1061
00:47:25,376 --> 00:47:27,343
Oh.
Then no dinner tonight.

1062
00:47:27,345 --> 00:47:30,179
Sorry. I was really
looking forward to it.

1063
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:31,681
But I'm hoping
we can pick another night.

1064
00:47:31,683 --> 00:47:33,716
Of course.
Come sit down.

1065
00:47:33,718 --> 00:47:35,551
Let me have your jacket.

1066
00:47:35,553 --> 00:47:36,953
-Oh.
-Just for a minute.

1067
00:47:36,955 --> 00:47:38,855
Come on. Relax.

1068
00:47:38,857 --> 00:47:41,524
Okay,
how about a foot massage?

1069
00:47:41,526 --> 00:47:42,992
During office hours?

1070
00:47:42,994 --> 00:47:45,294
Yeah,
that's kind of the point.

1071
00:47:45,296 --> 00:47:47,864
-May I?
-Well...

1072
00:47:47,866 --> 00:47:49,899
Okay.

1073
00:47:52,502 --> 00:47:53,870
It's already
pretty good.

1074
00:47:53,872 --> 00:47:55,838
All I've done
is take off your sock.

1075
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:58,007
Well,
no one's ever done that better.

1076
00:47:58,009 --> 00:47:59,575
Just relax.

1077
00:47:59,577 --> 00:48:00,877
Close your eyes.

1078
00:48:00,879 --> 00:48:02,545
Put your head back.

1079
00:48:02,547 --> 00:48:04,080
Oh.

1080
00:48:04,082 --> 00:48:06,082
So, when would you
like to reschedule?

1081
00:48:06,084 --> 00:48:07,650
- Tomorrow?

1082
00:48:07,652 --> 00:48:09,719
Can't tomorrow.
What about Saturday?

1083
00:48:09,721 --> 00:48:11,020
Good.

1084
00:48:11,022 --> 00:48:13,723
Oh, god.
This is enormously satisfying.

1085
00:48:13,725 --> 00:48:15,057
What time
should I pick you up?

1086
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:17,260
Noon?
I love daytime dates.

1087
00:48:17,262 --> 00:48:19,262
Lunch, perfect.
It's sooner.

1088
00:48:19,264 --> 00:48:21,731
So, how's it going?
How's Jules?

1089
00:48:21,733 --> 00:48:24,200
I mean, she works on
all cylinders all the time.

1090
00:48:24,202 --> 00:48:27,336
Doesn't stop, doesn't sleep,
never see her eat.

1091
00:48:27,338 --> 00:48:29,672
Maybe it's good that I'm here,
you know?

1092
00:48:29,674 --> 00:48:31,674
I hope I can help her.

1093
00:48:31,676 --> 00:48:34,577
I knew
you were gonna be a good guy.

1094
00:48:34,579 --> 00:48:35,978
I knew it.

1095
00:48:37,547 --> 00:48:39,248
Try to relax.

1096
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,783
Oh.

1097
00:48:40,785 --> 00:48:42,218
Oh.

1098
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:43,286
Oh.

1099
00:48:43,288 --> 00:48:44,787
Ooh.

1100
00:48:48,959 --> 00:48:51,661
Oh. Wow.

1101
00:48:53,063 --> 00:48:54,463
Oh, my god.

1102
00:48:54,465 --> 00:48:55,932
I'm sorry! I'm leaving!
I'm leaving!

1103
00:48:55,934 --> 00:48:57,967
Sorry! Don't stop!
I'm leaving.

1104
00:48:57,969 --> 00:48:59,235
Oh, my shoe.

1105
00:48:59,237 --> 00:49:00,469
Sorry.

1106
00:49:05,075 --> 00:49:06,575
-So?
-I don't know, kid.

1107
00:49:06,577 --> 00:49:08,277
This lease
doesn't look so hot to me.

1108
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:10,746
Three-month security deposit.
You must really love this place.

1109
00:49:10,748 --> 00:49:12,315
No, it's horrible.

1110
00:49:12,317 --> 00:49:14,884
But I can get in
this week.

1111
00:49:14,886 --> 00:49:17,119
Well, if I were you,
I'd keep looking.

1112
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:18,487
-Okay.
-Hey, Lewis.

1113
00:49:18,489 --> 00:49:20,723
What's up?
I've never seen you so awake.

1114
00:49:20,725 --> 00:49:23,659
I was just asked to deliver
this huge order to Tribeca,

1115
00:49:23,661 --> 00:49:25,394
and I think
it's to Jay z's apartment.

1116
00:49:25,396 --> 00:49:27,163
I'm not kidding.
Look, it says, "s. Carter."

1117
00:49:27,165 --> 00:49:29,298
-I'm a little freaked out.
-I don't know who that is,

1118
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,900
but is this
someone you want to impress?

1119
00:49:30,902 --> 00:49:32,735
This is a genius, Ben.

1120
00:49:32,737 --> 00:49:35,805
Whoa, what if Beyoncé
opens the door?
Oh, my god.

1121
00:49:35,807 --> 00:49:37,473
Okay, now I know
who you're talking about.

1122
00:49:37,475 --> 00:49:39,976
Well, maybe you should put on
a proper shirt with a collar.

1123
00:49:39,978 --> 00:49:41,944
A collar?
These are hip-hop people.

1124
00:49:41,946 --> 00:49:44,280
Dress to impress, Lewis.
Go to the rack.

1125
00:49:44,282 --> 00:49:45,982
Find a boyfriend shirt
that fits.

1126
00:49:45,984 --> 00:49:48,517
Bring the hair down if you can.
Tuck in the shirt.

1127
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:50,319
Why doesn't anybody
tuck anything in anymore?

1128
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:51,654
Oh, I'm asking you.

1129
00:49:51,656 --> 00:49:52,755
Okay, okay.

1130
00:49:52,757 --> 00:49:54,991
Benjamin...

1131
00:49:54,993 --> 00:49:56,659
We made some progress.

1132
00:49:56,661 --> 00:49:58,327
Very big day
for the intern team.

1133
00:49:58,329 --> 00:49:59,495
It was great.

1134
00:49:59,497 --> 00:50:00,796
I mean, she yelled at me,
but --

1135
00:50:00,798 --> 00:50:02,031
she yells at me
all the time, too.

1136
00:50:02,033 --> 00:50:03,299
Right?
It was communication.

1137
00:50:03,301 --> 00:50:04,433
-Yeah.
-It was a breakthrough.

1138
00:50:04,435 --> 00:50:05,701
Yeah.

1139
00:50:05,703 --> 00:50:07,436
Whoo!
Oh, you want one too?

1140
00:50:07,438 --> 00:50:09,038
-Yeah.
-Okay.

1141
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,540
Okay, boys. I'm possibly
meeting Jay z and/or Beyoncé,

1142
00:50:11,542 --> 00:50:12,842
and I'm in a blouse.

1143
00:50:12,844 --> 00:50:15,011
Wear it, dude.
It's an improvement.

1144
00:50:15,013 --> 00:50:16,012
Not true.

1145
00:50:16,014 --> 00:50:17,313
Big one.

1146
00:50:51,681 --> 00:50:54,383
-I hate eating alone.
-So do I.

1147
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:56,318
You know, you don't actually
have to keep doing that.

1148
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,387
Oh, force of habit.

1149
00:50:58,389 --> 00:50:59,588
Here you go.

1150
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:00,656
Swiped these
from the tech fridge.

1151
00:51:00,658 --> 00:51:02,091
Oh, nice going.

1152
00:51:02,093 --> 00:51:03,859
You want a slice?

1153
00:51:03,861 --> 00:51:05,795
Sure, thanks.

1154
00:51:08,031 --> 00:51:09,198
Cheers.

1155
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,466
Cheers.

1156
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:18,240
I noticed
a couple hours ago,

1157
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:20,709
you had a meeting
with another possible ceo.

1158
00:51:20,711 --> 00:51:23,012
I saw him arrive.
How'd that go?

1159
00:51:23,014 --> 00:51:24,880
It was going well...

1160
00:51:24,882 --> 00:51:26,415
Until he called us --

1161
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:29,218
I believe the term he used
was a "chick site."

1162
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:32,888
And I didn't hear
anything he said after that.

1163
00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:35,558
Apparently, selling clothes
makes us a "chick site."

1164
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:36,725
I mean, really?

1165
00:51:36,727 --> 00:51:38,227
How is this not legit?

1166
00:51:38,229 --> 00:51:40,963
I couldn't agree more.
I find that surprising.

1167
00:51:40,965 --> 00:51:43,432
Really?
Sexism in business?

1168
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:47,470
So...

1169
00:51:47,472 --> 00:51:49,772
What did you do for work, Ben,
before you retired?

1170
00:51:49,774 --> 00:51:52,274
I was a v.P.
For Dex one.

1171
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:53,442
Phonebooks?

1172
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:55,544
Yeah.
I was in charge of printing,

1173
00:51:55,546 --> 00:51:57,880
and before that I ran
sales and advertising.

1174
00:51:57,882 --> 00:51:59,682
Big jobs.

1175
00:52:01,818 --> 00:52:04,186
Wasn't this a factory
that used to make phonebooks?

1176
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:10,259
No. What?

1177
00:52:10,261 --> 00:52:12,294
-Yeah.
-What?

1178
00:52:12,296 --> 00:52:15,131
This is
where you worked?

1179
00:52:15,133 --> 00:52:17,399
For almost 40 years.

1180
00:52:19,937 --> 00:52:21,403
Yeah.

1181
00:52:21,405 --> 00:52:24,106
For twenty-some years
i sat right by that window.

1182
00:52:24,108 --> 00:52:26,242
That was my office.

1183
00:52:26,244 --> 00:52:29,445
It was
a few steps up back then.

1184
00:52:29,447 --> 00:52:32,148
We'd look out
over the whole factory.

1185
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:33,816
Our printing presses
were in that corner.

1186
00:52:33,818 --> 00:52:35,751
That's why the floor dips
back there.

1187
00:52:35,753 --> 00:52:37,353
No way.

1188
00:52:37,355 --> 00:52:39,121
I know everything
about this building.

1189
00:52:39,123 --> 00:52:40,756
Or used to.

1190
00:52:40,758 --> 00:52:42,691
You know the sycamores on
the other side of the building?

1191
00:52:42,693 --> 00:52:43,859
-Yeah.
-The big ones?

1192
00:52:43,861 --> 00:52:45,294
Yeah. The big ones.
I love them.

1193
00:52:45,296 --> 00:52:47,663
Yeah. I remember
the day they were planted.

1194
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:52,868
Is it totally weird
being back here?

1195
00:52:52,870 --> 00:52:54,537
Well,
it feels like home.

1196
00:52:54,539 --> 00:52:58,340
It's...Remodeled, but...

1197
00:52:58,342 --> 00:52:59,708
Home.

1198
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:06,549
So you're on Facebook,
huh?

1199
00:53:06,551 --> 00:53:08,050
Well, I've been trying to
figure it out.

1200
00:53:08,052 --> 00:53:09,518
I joined
about 10 minutes ago.

1201
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,820
Well, better late than never.

1202
00:53:11,822 --> 00:53:13,489
You want some help?

1203
00:53:13,491 --> 00:53:16,325
I'd love some, but, really,
you've got better things to do.

1204
00:53:16,327 --> 00:53:18,727
No,
i need a diversion.

1205
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:21,797
You have
a photo of yourself?

1206
00:53:21,799 --> 00:53:24,033
-No. I need one?
-If you want to look up

1207
00:53:24,035 --> 00:53:26,168
all those hotties
from high school, you do.

1208
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:27,503
Say cheese.

1209
00:53:27,505 --> 00:53:28,571
Cheese.

1210
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:31,874
That's cute.

1211
00:53:31,876 --> 00:53:34,944
Okay,
i just need to send that to you.

1212
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,580
Uh, all right.

1213
00:53:37,582 --> 00:53:39,381
So there are all these questions
for your profile

1214
00:53:39,383 --> 00:53:41,350
that you can answer
if you want to or not.

1215
00:53:41,352 --> 00:53:45,020
Like religious views,
political views...

1216
00:53:45,022 --> 00:53:47,056
People who inspire you...

1217
00:53:47,058 --> 00:53:49,425
Jules ostin.

1218
00:53:49,427 --> 00:53:50,859
I'm not trying to
brownnose you,

1219
00:53:50,861 --> 00:53:52,728
but I've been in business
a long time,

1220
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:55,598
and I've never run across
anyone quite like you.

1221
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,066
You do inspire, Jules.

1222
00:53:57,068 --> 00:53:58,434
I just knew,
at the end of the day,

1223
00:53:58,436 --> 00:54:00,069
that a woman
with a glass of wine

1224
00:54:00,071 --> 00:54:02,671
and a laptop
had real shopping potential.

1225
00:54:02,673 --> 00:54:05,174
And if you could actually
promise her things would fit...

1226
00:54:05,176 --> 00:54:06,275
See?
That's what I mean.

1227
00:54:06,277 --> 00:54:08,010
Okay.

1228
00:54:08,012 --> 00:54:10,346
Mm.
You have a favorite quote?

1229
00:54:10,348 --> 00:54:11,880
I do.

1230
00:54:11,882 --> 00:54:13,916
"You're never wrong
to do the right thing."

1231
00:54:13,918 --> 00:54:16,051
-Who said that, you?
-Yeah.

1232
00:54:16,053 --> 00:54:19,188
But I'm pretty sure
mark twain said it first.

1233
00:54:21,292 --> 00:54:22,758
Okay,
favorite music?

1234
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:25,928
Uh, geez. Sam Cooke,
one of my all-time favorites.

1235
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:28,264
Love miles Davis,
Billie holiday.

1236
00:54:28,266 --> 00:54:30,099
Oh,
she was great, right?

1237
00:54:30,101 --> 00:54:32,067
I mean,
she could just, like...

1238
00:54:32,069 --> 00:54:34,103
-Transport you.
-Oh, yeah.

1239
00:54:35,238 --> 00:54:37,640
Okay, books?

1240
00:54:37,642 --> 00:54:40,242
Love Clancy, ludlum.

1241
00:54:40,244 --> 00:54:42,044
Crazy about
"Harry Potter."

1242
00:54:42,046 --> 00:54:44,313
-Matt loves "Harry Potter," too.
-Oh, yeah?

1243
00:54:44,315 --> 00:54:45,814
Yeah, like, read them all
the week they came out.

1244
00:54:45,816 --> 00:54:49,485
Wow. Me, too.

1245
00:54:49,487 --> 00:54:51,887
Um, okay, what's
your relationship status?

1246
00:54:51,889 --> 00:54:54,256
Are you married?

1247
00:54:54,258 --> 00:54:55,624
Single?

1248
00:54:55,626 --> 00:54:58,327
Widower.

1249
00:54:58,329 --> 00:54:59,395
I'm sorry.

1250
00:55:03,233 --> 00:55:06,068
I think we should just
say single, then?

1251
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:08,837
Yeah.

1252
00:55:08,839 --> 00:55:12,107
Okay, do you know
what you need now?

1253
00:55:12,109 --> 00:55:14,310
You need
someone to friend.

1254
00:55:14,312 --> 00:55:16,312
I'll be friends
with the other interns.

1255
00:55:16,314 --> 00:55:18,080
They'll show me how to do it
in the morning.

1256
00:55:18,082 --> 00:55:20,282
Well, you --
you can friend me.

1257
00:55:20,284 --> 00:55:21,784
Okay, thank you.

1258
00:55:21,786 --> 00:55:22,918
Okay.

1259
00:55:26,356 --> 00:55:28,257
Okay.
Congratulations.

1260
00:55:28,259 --> 00:55:30,859
You are now officially part
of the Facebook generation.

1261
00:55:30,861 --> 00:55:33,696
- Good deal.

1262
00:55:33,698 --> 00:55:35,531
-Um, you done?
-Yes, thank you.

1263
00:55:35,533 --> 00:55:37,099
Okay.

1264
00:55:37,101 --> 00:55:40,002
Well, I have, uh,
about another hour of work.

1265
00:55:40,004 --> 00:55:41,603
You --
you okay with that?

1266
00:55:41,605 --> 00:55:43,072
Of course.

1267
00:55:44,307 --> 00:55:45,874
This was great, Jules.

1268
00:55:45,876 --> 00:55:47,843
Yeah.

1269
00:55:47,845 --> 00:55:52,548
It was nice to have an adult
conversation with an adult man,

1270
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:55,684
you know what I mean?
Like, not about work.

1271
00:55:55,686 --> 00:55:58,120
Not about...

1272
00:55:58,122 --> 00:56:00,155
I know what you mean.

1273
00:56:27,684 --> 00:56:29,651
Oh, we're here?

1274
00:56:29,653 --> 00:56:30,753
Yeah.

1275
00:56:30,755 --> 00:56:31,920
Was I snoring?

1276
00:56:31,922 --> 00:56:34,056
No, no, no.
Just sleeping.

1277
00:56:34,058 --> 00:56:35,991
Sorry.

1278
00:56:35,993 --> 00:56:37,860
My parents
are sleep researchers,

1279
00:56:37,862 --> 00:56:39,728
and they've been studying
my sleep my whole life.

1280
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:42,364
Apparently,
I'm a classic noisy sleeper.

1281
00:56:42,366 --> 00:56:43,999
Fun getting to know me,
huh?

1282
00:56:44,001 --> 00:56:45,834
- It is.

1283
00:56:48,338 --> 00:56:52,708
I never fall asleep in the car,
so that was actually amazing.

1284
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:54,009
Apologize
for the racket.

1285
00:56:54,011 --> 00:56:56,044
Barely noticed.

1286
00:56:56,046 --> 00:56:58,947
I'll pretend
i believe you.

1287
00:57:00,718 --> 00:57:02,885
I love this house.

1288
00:57:02,887 --> 00:57:05,120
It just
looks happy to me.

1289
00:57:05,122 --> 00:57:06,955
Like,
if it was in a kid's book,

1290
00:57:06,957 --> 00:57:10,392
it would make you feel good when
you turned the page and saw it.

1291
00:57:10,394 --> 00:57:11,693
You know what I mean?

1292
00:57:11,695 --> 00:57:14,229
I do.

1293
00:57:14,231 --> 00:57:15,964
Well...

1294
00:57:19,302 --> 00:57:20,869
<i> Sayonara.</i>

1295
00:57:20,871 --> 00:57:22,971
<i> Sayonara.</i>

1296
00:57:33,716 --> 00:57:37,219
I didn't
hear you come in.

1297
00:57:37,221 --> 00:57:39,254
You know...

1298
00:57:39,256 --> 00:57:42,458
I was thinking...

1299
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:45,227
We need
some awake time together.

1300
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:59,808
Yeah, that, too.

1301
00:58:24,968 --> 00:58:26,134
Morning.

1302
00:58:26,136 --> 00:58:28,170
Good morning.
I'm Doris.

1303
00:58:28,172 --> 00:58:29,671
They asked me
to drive you today.

1304
00:58:29,673 --> 00:58:30,839
Are you
all set back there?

1305
00:58:30,841 --> 00:58:32,441
You got
your seat belt fastened?

1306
00:58:32,443 --> 00:58:33,809
What happened to Ben?

1307
00:58:33,811 --> 00:58:37,513
Oh, somebody said
that he got transferred.

1308
00:58:37,515 --> 00:58:41,517
Um, you know the best way
to get back to headquarters?

1309
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:44,119
-Oh!
-Oh, my!

1310
00:58:44,121 --> 00:58:45,487
Oh, what--

1311
00:58:45,489 --> 00:58:48,624
-come on!
-Hold your horses, maniac!

1312
00:58:50,059 --> 00:58:52,394
Which way, hon?

1313
00:58:52,396 --> 00:58:53,695
-I'm all turned around here.
-Doris.

1314
00:58:53,697 --> 00:58:55,297
-Doris! Doris!
-What? What?!

1315
00:58:55,299 --> 00:58:57,466
You told me
to transfer him.

1316
00:58:57,468 --> 00:59:00,168
That was two days ago.
Why didn't you check with me?

1317
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:02,337
First of all,
that was yesterday.

1318
00:59:02,339 --> 00:59:05,073
Well, where is he?
Do you know?

1319
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:11,146
Thank you.

1320
00:59:15,985 --> 00:59:18,554
You must think
I'm demented.

1321
00:59:18,556 --> 00:59:19,988
Not the word I would use,

1322
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:22,357
but I was a little surprised
when I got the call.

1323
00:59:22,359 --> 00:59:25,561
Jules, I apologize
if I overstepped in some way.

1324
00:59:25,563 --> 00:59:27,563
No. No, no, no.
No, please don't apologize.

1325
00:59:27,565 --> 00:59:29,398
You have done
nothing wrong.

1326
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:33,235
Look, I have a lot going on,
and I'm a very private person.

1327
00:59:33,237 --> 00:59:34,703
And at first, I don't know,
i thought

1328
00:59:34,705 --> 00:59:36,838
maybe this wasn't gonna work,
but I was wrong.

1329
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:38,273
Let me get
one of those.

1330
00:59:38,275 --> 00:59:39,608
-No, no, no.
-No.

1331
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:41,510
Jules, no explanation necessary.
Please.

1332
00:59:41,512 --> 00:59:45,414
No, actually, one is because
i am usually better than this.

1333
00:59:47,117 --> 00:59:50,052
The truth is...

1334
00:59:50,054 --> 00:59:51,587
Something about you
makes me feel calm

1335
00:59:51,589 --> 00:59:55,457
or more centered or something,
and i-i could use that.

1336
00:59:55,459 --> 00:59:58,060
Obviously.

1337
00:59:58,062 --> 01:00:01,730
I hope you'll accept my apology
and come back to work for me.

1338
01:00:01,732 --> 01:00:03,365
If you want.

1339
01:00:03,367 --> 01:00:04,566
And I'm not just saying this

1340
01:00:04,568 --> 01:00:05,901
because
i screwed up this morning.

1341
01:00:05,903 --> 01:00:07,803
But I was thinking that

1342
01:00:07,805 --> 01:00:10,706
I'd like to bring you up to
my area, next to Becky.

1343
01:00:10,708 --> 01:00:14,376
I know you can handle more work.
If you'd like more. I...

1344
01:00:14,378 --> 01:00:16,211
Oh, god, I can't tell you
how much I hate

1345
01:00:16,213 --> 01:00:17,646
that I jumped the gun
and I made you feel--

1346
01:00:17,648 --> 01:00:19,948
I'm coming back.
I-I'm happy to come back.

1347
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:21,950
Excellent.

1348
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:23,986
Can I give you a lift
back to the office?

1349
01:00:23,988 --> 01:00:25,287
Sure, thanks.
Can I take this?

1350
01:00:25,289 --> 01:00:27,055
No.

1351
01:00:28,726 --> 01:00:30,392
Actually,
do you mind driving?

1352
01:00:30,394 --> 01:00:32,694
I don't technically
have a license.
Sure.

1353
01:00:37,834 --> 01:00:39,401
This is --
this is crazy, Ben.

1354
01:00:39,403 --> 01:00:40,736
Two desks
are not gonna fit in here.

1355
01:00:40,738 --> 01:00:42,304
No, I promise
I'll stay out of your way.

1356
01:00:42,306 --> 01:00:44,306
But it's impossible because
now I don't have room for --

1357
01:00:44,308 --> 01:00:45,507
-hi.
-Hi.

1358
01:00:45,509 --> 01:00:46,842
This is good, right?

1359
01:00:46,844 --> 01:00:48,477
I like this arrangement.

1360
01:00:48,479 --> 01:00:50,812
Uh, Becky, I want you to let Ben
give you a hand, okay?

1361
01:00:50,814 --> 01:00:52,280
And cc him
on all my e-mails?

1362
01:00:52,282 --> 01:00:53,649
Did we get
yesterday's numbers?

1363
01:00:53,651 --> 01:00:57,252
Uh, yes, we did.
I saw them here...

1364
01:00:59,789 --> 01:01:01,623
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

1365
01:01:01,625 --> 01:01:03,759
And I need to go over the data
on customer purchase patterns.

1366
01:01:03,761 --> 01:01:05,260
Let Ben take a look
at that, too.

1367
01:01:05,262 --> 01:01:07,129
Actually, let Ben
take a look at that first.

1368
01:01:07,131 --> 01:01:08,430
Okay.

1369
01:01:08,432 --> 01:01:10,365
Don't worry, Becky.
Backup's good.

1370
01:01:10,367 --> 01:01:12,034
Ping me
when Cameron gets in?

1371
01:01:28,051 --> 01:01:29,618
Hey.

1372
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:32,788
Becky?

1373
01:01:32,790 --> 01:01:35,023
I've been here nine months, Ben,
and she's never asked me

1374
01:01:35,025 --> 01:01:38,226
to take a look at anything
for her ever, okay?

1375
01:01:38,228 --> 01:01:39,895
I hear you.
That's frustrating.

1376
01:01:39,897 --> 01:01:42,064
I mean, totally.
I graduated from penn.

1377
01:01:42,066 --> 01:01:43,632
I have a business degree.

1378
01:01:43,634 --> 01:01:46,234
But I never seem to do
anything right around here.

1379
01:01:46,236 --> 01:01:50,238
And you're like 50 years older
than me and you're deaf.

1380
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:53,108
I happen to think you do
a lot of things right.

1381
01:01:53,843 --> 01:01:57,312
You do so much.

1382
01:01:57,314 --> 01:01:59,414
I know.
I know that.

1383
01:01:59,416 --> 01:02:00,982
-Mm-hmm.
-But she doesn't.

1384
01:02:00,984 --> 01:02:04,986
I mean, I bust my ass for her
14 hours a day,

1385
01:02:04,988 --> 01:02:07,022
and she never notices.

1386
01:02:07,024 --> 01:02:09,324
Oh. Oh, my god.

1387
01:02:09,326 --> 01:02:12,427
I hate
girls who cry at work.

1388
01:02:12,429 --> 01:02:14,529
How 'bout if you,
just as an experiment,

1389
01:02:14,531 --> 01:02:15,897
try letting me help you.

1390
01:02:15,899 --> 01:02:17,532
A lot of your stress
is gonna be lifted

1391
01:02:17,534 --> 01:02:19,434
once you're out from under
this mountain of worry.

1392
01:02:19,436 --> 01:02:21,870
And maybe you should consider
leaving here at a normal hour

1393
01:02:21,872 --> 01:02:23,105
once in a while.

1394
01:02:23,107 --> 01:02:24,706
See your friends.
Have a little fun.

1395
01:02:24,708 --> 01:02:28,176
Mm-hmm. I can offer
my assistance in this area.

1396
01:02:28,178 --> 01:02:31,880
I would love to,
actually.

1397
01:02:31,882 --> 01:02:35,884
I just don't want her to think
that I can't do my job

1398
01:02:35,886 --> 01:02:37,786
and I need an intern
to help me.

1399
01:02:37,788 --> 01:02:39,921
Okay, you're not gonna
want to hear this,

1400
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:43,058
but I heard women who sleep
less than seven hours a night

1401
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:44,760
gain 38% more weight

1402
01:02:44,762 --> 01:02:47,229
than women who sleep
more than seven hours a night.

1403
01:02:47,231 --> 01:02:48,964
What?!

1404
01:02:48,966 --> 01:02:50,766
I leave here at 11:00.
I get back at 7:00.

1405
01:02:50,768 --> 01:02:54,770
I sleep like five hours a night,
and now I'm gonna get fat?

1406
01:02:54,772 --> 01:02:56,905
Let's get through this stuff.
Let's do it together.

1407
01:02:56,907 --> 01:02:58,406
Let's clean-slate it.

1408
01:02:58,408 --> 01:02:59,608
Let's just do it.

1409
01:02:59,610 --> 01:03:01,910
-Yes!
-Very nice, St. Louis.

1410
01:03:01,912 --> 01:03:04,146
-Ah, suede jacket in D.C.
-i cannot believe how well
that sweater is doing.

1411
01:03:04,148 --> 01:03:05,814
-I'm so happy.

1412
01:03:05,816 --> 01:03:08,450
-Beautiful, Miami! Thank you.
-Oh! Look at Chicago!

1413
01:03:08,452 --> 01:03:10,418
She put the same boots in her
cart as the woman from Houston.

1414
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:12,053
Okay, let's see
what she does at checkout.

1415
01:03:13,657 --> 01:03:15,657
She's not
buying them either.

1416
01:03:15,659 --> 01:03:17,459
Okay, maybe check the
delivery cost on those boots?

1417
01:03:17,461 --> 01:03:18,460
Mm-hmm.

1418
01:03:19,762 --> 01:03:21,296
-Knock-knock.
-Hey.

1419
01:03:21,298 --> 01:03:23,665
Hi. I took a look
at the data purchase patterns.

1420
01:03:23,667 --> 01:03:25,467
Uh, should I come back?

1421
01:03:25,469 --> 01:03:27,335
No, no, come on in.
That was fast.

1422
01:03:27,337 --> 01:03:29,137
Well,
i enlisted Becky's help.

1423
01:03:29,139 --> 01:03:32,073
It seems the most expensive
place you're advertising

1424
01:03:32,075 --> 01:03:34,943
is actually bringing you
the customers who are
spending the least.

1425
01:03:34,945 --> 01:03:37,279
And the channels
you're least investing in

1426
01:03:37,281 --> 01:03:40,415
are adding enormous value
in segments that currently
appear to have low value

1427
01:03:40,417 --> 01:03:43,451
but actually have
the highest spending potential.

1428
01:03:43,453 --> 01:03:46,822
That's what I could tell
so far.

1429
01:03:46,824 --> 01:03:49,257
Oh, Ben. Can you, like,
deal with that for me?

1430
01:03:49,259 --> 01:03:50,458
Maybe come up with
a better plan?

1431
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:51,927
I mean,
if you have the time?

1432
01:03:51,929 --> 01:03:53,395
Happy to.

1433
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:56,531
The man spent 40 years
in business.

1434
01:03:56,533 --> 01:03:57,833
Yeah, no, I get it.

1435
01:03:57,835 --> 01:03:59,801
And, Jules, Becky
was a huge help in this.

1436
01:03:59,803 --> 01:04:01,636
You know she has
a business degree from penn?

1437
01:04:01,638 --> 01:04:03,138
I know.

1438
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:05,707
I mean, I forgot,
but I know.

1439
01:04:10,046 --> 01:04:12,180
I'll say something
to her.

1440
01:04:12,182 --> 01:04:13,849
That would be very nice.

1441
01:04:13,851 --> 01:04:16,451
Hey. How's it goin' up here
in first-class?

1442
01:04:16,453 --> 01:04:18,720
Busy. I see
you found an apartment.

1443
01:04:18,722 --> 01:04:19,855
No.

1444
01:04:19,857 --> 01:04:21,122
My two weeks are up.

1445
01:04:21,124 --> 01:04:22,457
I'm movin' in
with my cousin.

1446
01:04:22,459 --> 01:04:23,391
Excellent.

1447
01:04:23,393 --> 01:04:24,960
In Philadelphia.

1448
01:04:24,962 --> 01:04:26,228
-Davis.
-What?

1449
01:04:26,230 --> 01:04:28,163
I'll get there by 11:00,
leave at 5:00.

1450
01:04:28,165 --> 01:04:29,831
It's cool.
I can handle it.

1451
01:04:29,833 --> 01:04:32,734
You know, I feel like
everybody's uncle around here.

1452
01:04:32,736 --> 01:04:34,002
Yeah, why is that?

1453
01:04:34,004 --> 01:04:35,337
Because
I'm gonna save your ass,

1454
01:04:35,339 --> 01:04:37,172
and I'm gonna put you up
for a few weeks.

1455
01:04:37,174 --> 01:04:38,173
Obviously.

1456
01:04:38,175 --> 01:04:39,674
Ben, thank you.

1457
01:04:39,676 --> 01:04:41,309
Mwah!
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

1458
01:04:41,311 --> 01:04:43,245
Okay. Okay.
Easy, fella.

1459
01:04:46,649 --> 01:04:48,717
Davis: I like that you do
the throw pillow thing.

1460
01:04:48,719 --> 01:04:50,986
I was married
for a very long time.

1461
01:04:50,988 --> 01:04:53,054
Mm.

1462
01:04:53,056 --> 01:04:56,091
Whoa.
Is this your closet?

1463
01:04:56,093 --> 01:04:58,994
Busy man about town.

1464
01:04:58,996 --> 01:05:00,695
What's in
all these drawers?

1465
01:05:00,697 --> 01:05:03,732
Boxers, t-shirts,
pocket squares, handkerchiefs.

1466
01:05:03,734 --> 01:05:05,667
Okay, what's the deal
with the handkerchief?

1467
01:05:05,669 --> 01:05:07,168
That one
i just don't get at all.

1468
01:05:07,170 --> 01:05:08,603
Okay. It's essential.

1469
01:05:08,605 --> 01:05:11,006
That your generation
doesn't know that is criminal.

1470
01:05:11,008 --> 01:05:13,708
The best reason to carry
a handkerchief is to lend it.

1471
01:05:13,710 --> 01:05:15,443
Ask Jason about this.

1472
01:05:15,445 --> 01:05:16,845
Women cry, Davis.

1473
01:05:16,847 --> 01:05:18,246
We carry it for them.

1474
01:05:18,248 --> 01:05:20,782
One of the last vestiges
of the chivalrous gent.

1475
01:05:20,784 --> 01:05:22,617
Oh. Well, then
it's different than a po--

1476
01:05:22,619 --> 01:05:24,085
I know you want to hang,
but I --

1477
01:05:24,087 --> 01:05:26,421
I have to get some sleep, kid.
I'm pooped.

1478
01:05:26,423 --> 01:05:27,689
Good night, Ben.

1479
01:05:29,025 --> 01:05:30,525
Thanks again.

1480
01:05:32,528 --> 01:05:35,397
Will you wake me in the morning
or is that too much to ask?

1481
01:05:35,399 --> 01:05:37,232
-My parents always--
-too much.

1482
01:05:37,234 --> 01:05:39,901
Understood. I'll just
set an alarm on my phone.

1483
01:05:39,903 --> 01:05:42,570
I hope I can hear it.
I'm such a deep sleeper.

1484
01:05:42,572 --> 01:05:44,306
Oh, my god.
I'll wake you.

1485
01:05:44,308 --> 01:05:45,707
Thank you!

1486
01:05:45,709 --> 01:05:48,109
Love you!
Not kidding!

1487
01:05:48,111 --> 01:05:50,946
I love you, too.
Now go to bed.

1488
01:05:50,948 --> 01:05:53,048
Here's some more berries,
guys.

1489
01:05:53,050 --> 01:05:55,717
Ben, can you pour me
more syrup, please?

1490
01:05:55,719 --> 01:05:57,118
Sure can.

1491
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:58,954
There you go.

1492
01:05:58,956 --> 01:06:00,288
Perfect.
Good job.

1493
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:02,057
Oh, thanks.

1494
01:06:02,059 --> 01:06:06,294
Oh, boy. Okay, so, this really
big ceo named townsend,

1495
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:07,796
the one everyone said would
never be interested in us

1496
01:06:07,798 --> 01:06:09,297
because we weren't
big enough for him?

1497
01:06:09,299 --> 01:06:10,498
-Yeah?
-Yeah?

1498
01:06:12,235 --> 01:06:14,970
We're like
your sister wives.

1499
01:06:14,972 --> 01:06:17,906
Well, we just found out
he's beyond interested.

1500
01:06:17,908 --> 01:06:19,574
Exciting.

1501
01:06:19,576 --> 01:06:21,343
Yeah.

1502
01:06:21,345 --> 01:06:22,677
Maybe.

1503
01:06:22,679 --> 01:06:24,179
Everyone's flipping out
about it,

1504
01:06:24,181 --> 01:06:26,247
but you know
I'm still on the fence at best.

1505
01:06:26,249 --> 01:06:27,682
Anyway,
the only thing is,

1506
01:06:27,684 --> 01:06:29,184
I have to go to San Francisco
to meet him.

1507
01:06:29,186 --> 01:06:31,619
-He can't come here.
-When do you have to go?

1508
01:06:31,621 --> 01:06:33,989
The only day he can meet
is next Thursday.

1509
01:06:33,991 --> 01:06:35,457
Do you want to come?

1510
01:06:35,459 --> 01:06:37,092
Maybe
we can stay the weekend?

1511
01:06:37,094 --> 01:06:40,362
Oh, that sounds awesome.
Um...

1512
01:06:40,364 --> 01:06:42,831
Oh, Thursday I can't.

1513
01:06:42,833 --> 01:06:44,632
Paige is snack leader
at school,

1514
01:06:44,634 --> 01:06:46,201
and I'm supposed to be
in the class with her.

1515
01:06:46,203 --> 01:06:48,003
-It's kind of a big deal.
-Right.

1516
01:06:48,005 --> 01:06:49,971
Yeah,
it's a really big deal.

1517
01:06:49,973 --> 01:06:51,773
No, I know, sweetie.
I'm sorry. I forgot.

1518
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:54,642
Uh,
maybe Ben could go with you.

1519
01:06:54,644 --> 01:06:57,512
Yeah,
that's a good idea.

1520
01:06:57,514 --> 01:06:59,381
Guys,
Ben has a life.

1521
01:06:59,383 --> 01:07:00,849
Uh, not really.

1522
01:07:00,851 --> 01:07:02,550
Not one that takes me
to San Francisco.

1523
01:07:02,552 --> 01:07:04,719
If you want the company,
I'd love to go.

1524
01:07:04,721 --> 01:07:05,820
Really?

1525
01:07:05,822 --> 01:07:08,156
Definitely.

1526
01:07:08,158 --> 01:07:09,524
-Guess what, Ben?
-Yes?

1527
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:11,526
Today,
my dad's gonna be Ariel.

1528
01:07:11,528 --> 01:07:12,894
It's his turn.

1529
01:07:12,896 --> 01:07:15,563
-Oh, that's good, right?
-Really good.

1530
01:07:15,565 --> 01:07:17,699
Matt: You guys think
finding a ceo is a big deal?

1531
01:07:17,701 --> 01:07:20,802
Here, the big negotiation
is who gets to be Ariel

1532
01:07:20,804 --> 01:07:22,871
when we're playing
"little mermaid."

1533
01:07:22,873 --> 01:07:24,839
And for the record,
it's never been my turn.

1534
01:07:24,841 --> 01:07:26,007
- Mnh-mnh.

1535
01:07:26,009 --> 01:07:27,742
So this is huge for me.
I'm excited.

1536
01:07:27,744 --> 01:07:30,311
I get to comb my hair
with a fork...

1537
01:07:30,313 --> 01:07:32,414
...play with gadgets
and gizmos aplenty.

1538
01:07:32,416 --> 01:07:34,349
Daddy!

1539
01:07:34,351 --> 01:07:35,817
This is Jules.

1540
01:07:35,819 --> 01:07:37,552
So, guys, how long
till we get it fixed?

1541
01:07:37,554 --> 01:07:40,255
I mean, if you can't zoom in,
you probably won't buy.

1542
01:07:40,257 --> 01:07:42,857
Yeah, the first couple
hours are already down 23%.

1543
01:07:42,859 --> 01:07:44,325
-Oh, boy.
-Okay.

1544
01:07:44,327 --> 01:07:46,094
-I will be there in like...
-Two minutes.

1545
01:07:46,096 --> 01:07:48,329
-...two minutes.
-We're on it.

1546
01:07:48,331 --> 01:07:50,565
Ben, do you have the info
on friends shopping together?

1547
01:07:51,568 --> 01:07:53,501
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

1548
01:07:53,503 --> 01:07:55,403
-This is Jules.
-What's wrong?

1549
01:07:55,405 --> 01:07:56,838
Oh, mom, hi.

1550
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:58,440
Um, I just found out
that the zoom link --

1551
01:07:58,442 --> 01:08:00,675
um, the button that you click on
to zoom in on a photo,

1552
01:08:00,677 --> 01:08:03,278
-isn't working.
-That doesn't sound like
such a big deal.

1553
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:05,080
Well, actually, it is.
Um...

1554
01:08:05,082 --> 01:08:08,616
It's what people use to get
a closer look at what --

1555
01:08:08,618 --> 01:08:10,351
everybody zooms in.

1556
01:08:10,353 --> 01:08:12,554
I guess I don't go to your
website enough to know that.

1557
01:08:18,428 --> 01:08:20,295
Oh, typing and ringing.

1558
01:08:20,297 --> 01:08:21,963
Yeah, sorry.
Oh, it's the warehouse.

1559
01:08:21,965 --> 01:08:23,298
Mom, I'm sorry.
Can I call you back?

1560
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:24,933
-No need.
-Okay, love you.

1561
01:08:24,935 --> 01:08:26,134
Yep.

1562
01:08:26,136 --> 01:08:28,937
Who says "yep"
to "i love you"?

1563
01:08:33,909 --> 01:08:35,243
Hi, Alonzo.

1564
01:08:35,245 --> 01:08:36,244
Hi, Jules.

1565
01:08:36,246 --> 01:08:37,579
Not good news.

1566
01:08:37,581 --> 01:08:39,314
What? Okay.
Lay it on me.

1567
01:08:39,316 --> 01:08:41,716
In a routine check
by the sanitation department,

1568
01:08:41,718 --> 01:08:43,151
they found one bedbug.

1569
01:08:43,153 --> 01:08:45,453
-No.
-Unfortunately, yes.

1570
01:08:45,455 --> 01:08:47,655
We sent out 4,800 boxes
yesterday.

1571
01:08:47,657 --> 01:08:49,924
We have to get them all back,
shut down the warehouse...

1572
01:08:49,926 --> 01:08:51,326
-Ugh.
-...Spray for bedbugs,

1573
01:08:51,328 --> 01:08:53,128
then we can start shipping
again.

1574
01:08:53,130 --> 01:08:54,329
-Nightmare.
-Nightmare.

1575
01:08:54,331 --> 01:08:55,563
Okay, here we are.

1576
01:08:55,565 --> 01:08:57,398
Okay,
let me just finish this e-mail.

1577
01:09:15,986 --> 01:09:17,519
No!

1578
01:09:17,521 --> 01:09:18,686
No.

1579
01:09:18,688 --> 01:09:19,854
No, no, no.

1580
01:09:27,664 --> 01:09:29,697
Hey, guys.
Thanks for coming.

1581
01:09:29,699 --> 01:09:31,132
I know the zoom is broken,

1582
01:09:31,134 --> 01:09:32,467
and I don't mean to
pull anyone off of that,

1583
01:09:32,469 --> 01:09:34,302
but I need a favor.

1584
01:09:34,304 --> 01:09:36,271
I accidentally sent an e-mail
to the wrong person,

1585
01:09:36,273 --> 01:09:38,173
and she's at work
right now.

1586
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:39,674
And I know she doesn't check
her personal e-mail

1587
01:09:39,676 --> 01:09:41,342
until she gets home
at 5:30.

1588
01:09:41,344 --> 01:09:43,178
So I have until then
to figure out how to delete it.

1589
01:09:43,180 --> 01:09:46,047
Because if this person sees
this e-mail, it'll be horrible.

1590
01:09:46,049 --> 01:09:48,516
And on top of that,
she has a minor heart condition.

1591
01:09:48,518 --> 01:09:50,552
I think this could
possibly be not good for that.

1592
01:09:50,554 --> 01:09:54,289
So I am counting on
your good graces and brilliance

1593
01:09:54,291 --> 01:09:56,391
to figure out
a way to save my ass.

1594
01:09:56,393 --> 01:09:58,059
Truthfully, Jules,
it's pretty impossible

1595
01:09:58,061 --> 01:09:59,527
to hack into a server.

1596
01:09:59,529 --> 01:10:01,196
Techie #2: And you don't
know her password?

1597
01:10:01,198 --> 01:10:02,697
No idea.

1598
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:04,899
Jules, I think there's only
one thing we can do.

1599
01:10:04,901 --> 01:10:06,367
What? Tell me.
I'm dying.

1600
01:10:06,369 --> 01:10:08,002
Me and the boys take off,

1601
01:10:08,004 --> 01:10:10,838
we break into your mom's house,
and we steal her computer.

1602
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:13,241
Break into her house
and steal the computer?

1603
01:10:13,243 --> 01:10:14,642
Are you kidding me?

1604
01:10:15,978 --> 01:10:17,879
That's freaking genius.

1605
01:10:17,881 --> 01:10:20,982
Female GPS voice:
<i>You will reach your destination</i>

1606
01:10:20,984 --> 01:10:23,184
<i> in 300 yards.</i>

1607
01:10:23,186 --> 01:10:27,088
Little does GPS lady know
she is an accomplice to a crime.

1608
01:10:27,090 --> 01:10:29,257
The woman has a heart condition.
Think of it as a good deed.

1609
01:10:29,259 --> 01:10:31,826
I never thought you'd be a bad
influence on me, whittaker.

1610
01:10:31,828 --> 01:10:34,262
Oh, relax, fellas. This is
gonna be a piece of cake.

1611
01:10:34,264 --> 01:10:35,697
The key
is under a flowerpot.

1612
01:10:35,699 --> 01:10:37,732
We go in, we delete,
we disappear.

1613
01:10:37,734 --> 01:10:38,866
She doesn't have an alarm,
right?

1614
01:10:38,868 --> 01:10:40,368
Nope.
She does not.

1615
01:10:40,370 --> 01:10:42,270
What if there's, like,
a password on the e-mail? Hmm?

1616
01:10:42,272 --> 01:10:43,905
Then
we take the computer.

1617
01:10:43,907 --> 01:10:46,674
Jules said she'd buy her
a new one, so it's a win-win.

1618
01:10:46,676 --> 01:10:49,944
You will reach your destination
in 100 yards.

1619
01:10:49,946 --> 01:10:51,346
This is like
an "oceans" movie.

1620
01:10:51,348 --> 01:10:53,348
Ben's the old guy
with the big glasses.

1621
01:10:53,350 --> 01:10:54,916
His name is Elliott gould.

1622
01:10:54,918 --> 01:10:57,185
Yeah, and, Jason,
you're Clooney.
Thank you.

1623
01:10:57,187 --> 01:10:59,087
And I'll be Matt Damon
'cause I'm kind of an outsider.

1624
01:10:59,089 --> 01:11:00,455
Yeah, definitely.
Who am I?

1625
01:11:00,457 --> 01:11:02,056
Uh, you are
Ben affleck's brother.

1626
01:11:02,058 --> 01:11:03,725
Well,
why aren't I Brad Pitt?

1627
01:11:03,727 --> 01:11:06,728
I think that's kind of
self-explanatory.

1628
01:11:16,305 --> 01:11:17,705
-Okay, Clooney.
-Thank you.

1629
01:11:17,707 --> 01:11:18,940
You're behind the wheel.

1630
01:11:18,942 --> 01:11:20,275
Park on the street.

1631
01:11:20,277 --> 01:11:22,210
Keep the engine running,
your eyes open.

1632
01:11:22,212 --> 01:11:24,812
Damon, affleck's brother,
you're with me.

1633
01:11:24,814 --> 01:11:26,114
All right,
let's do this.

1634
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:30,351
Remember,
the key's under the flowerpot.

1635
01:11:47,971 --> 01:11:49,270
Oh, no.

1636
01:11:49,272 --> 01:11:51,773
Oh, great plan so far.
Oh, my god.

1637
01:11:51,775 --> 01:11:53,741
-Lewis, get Becky.
-If we don't know the code,

1638
01:11:53,743 --> 01:11:55,343
this is gonna turn into an alarm
in 60 seconds.

1639
01:11:55,345 --> 01:11:57,111
Becky, put Jules on.

1640
01:11:57,113 --> 01:11:58,813
She put me on hold.
What is wrong with that girl?

1641
01:11:58,815 --> 01:12:01,416
This is so not good.
What are we supposed to do, Ben?

1642
01:12:01,418 --> 01:12:02,617
-What are we supposed--
-stop eating!

1643
01:12:02,619 --> 01:12:03,785
-Uh-huh!
-Go look for the computer!

1644
01:12:03,787 --> 01:12:05,286
Right now!
Go! Go! Go!

1645
01:12:05,288 --> 01:12:06,821
No! Separately!
Separate--

1646
01:12:06,823 --> 01:12:08,656
Ben.
Ben, you there?

1647
01:12:08,658 --> 01:12:10,591
Becky, don't screw around.
Put Jules on. It's an emergency.

1648
01:12:10,593 --> 01:12:12,860
-She's in a meeting.
-Interrupt her.

1649
01:12:12,862 --> 01:12:14,095
Ben, what's up?

1650
01:12:14,097 --> 01:12:15,697
Jules,
your mother has an alarm.

1651
01:12:15,699 --> 01:12:17,498
-No, she doesn't.
-Yes, she does.

1652
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:19,300
I'm in her kitchen. It's about
to go off. What's her code?

1653
01:12:19,302 --> 01:12:21,135
I have no idea.
Ben, listen to me.

1654
01:12:21,137 --> 01:12:22,470
I know this woman.

1655
01:12:22,472 --> 01:12:23,871
That is a fake alarm
that she bought

1656
01:12:23,873 --> 01:12:25,173
off of some infomercial
or something, okay?

1657
01:12:25,175 --> 01:12:26,607
It's not real.
It's not connected.

1658
01:12:26,609 --> 01:12:28,176
It's just to
scare off burglars.

1659
01:12:28,178 --> 01:12:29,844
She says it's fake.
It's just to scare off burglars.

1660
01:12:29,846 --> 01:12:31,646
Oh, well,
it's doing a good job.

1661
01:12:31,648 --> 01:12:33,815
Listen, my parents would never
pay for an alarm, okay?

1662
01:12:33,817 --> 01:12:35,383
They're the cheapest people
in America.

1663
01:12:35,385 --> 01:12:37,552
Okay, well, it hasn't
turned into an alarm yet.

1664
01:12:37,554 --> 01:12:39,554
-It's still beeping.
-That's 'cause it's a fake.

1665
01:12:39,556 --> 01:12:41,122
Trust me on this one.
Have you found the computer?

1666
01:12:41,124 --> 01:12:42,490
It's not down here.

1667
01:12:47,229 --> 01:12:49,063
Lewis, go in there.
Davis, in there.

1668
01:12:51,734 --> 01:12:54,135
-Found it!
-Got it! What?

1669
01:12:54,137 --> 01:12:56,070
We found two. Which one is hers?
The white one or the silver one?

1670
01:12:56,072 --> 01:12:57,739
The white one
or the silver one?

1671
01:12:57,741 --> 01:12:59,073
The white one or the silver one?
White one or the silver one?

1672
01:12:59,075 --> 01:13:00,408
-Your mom's computer?
-Yes.

1673
01:13:00,410 --> 01:13:01,676
It's white.
I got it fixed for her once.

1674
01:13:01,678 --> 01:13:03,144
-I am positive.
-The white one!

1675
01:13:03,146 --> 01:13:04,612
White.

1676
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:10,251
Oh, my god.

1677
01:13:10,253 --> 01:13:12,720
I knew there was no such thing
as a fake alarm!

1678
01:13:12,722 --> 01:13:14,389
We're gonna get arrested!
I knew it!

1679
01:13:14,391 --> 01:13:15,823
That's it! We're done!

1680
01:13:15,825 --> 01:13:17,692
Our fingerprints
are all over this place!

1681
01:13:17,694 --> 01:13:19,160
Ben,
do you see the e-mail?

1682
01:13:19,162 --> 01:13:21,062
-Not yet.
-Double-time it, dude.

1683
01:13:21,064 --> 01:13:23,431
Here, let me.

1684
01:13:23,433 --> 01:13:24,899
Found it!

1685
01:13:24,901 --> 01:13:26,901
"Why is my mother
always such a raging bitch?"

1686
01:13:26,903 --> 01:13:28,770
Subject --
"she's a terrorist."

1687
01:13:28,772 --> 01:13:30,104
Yes! Delete it!

1688
01:13:30,106 --> 01:13:31,239
Gone.

1689
01:13:31,241 --> 01:13:32,507
Now from the trash!

1690
01:13:34,443 --> 01:13:35,543
Got it.

1691
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:38,513
Davis,
where'd you find this?

1692
01:13:38,515 --> 01:13:39,614
Under the bed, right side.

1693
01:13:39,616 --> 01:13:41,182
Which right side?

1694
01:13:41,184 --> 01:13:43,351
Right side facing the bed!
Oh, my god! My life is over!

1695
01:13:43,353 --> 01:13:45,753
I'm gonna be a felon and
i have not committed a crime!

1696
01:13:45,755 --> 01:13:47,088
Davis.
Davis, pull it together.

1697
01:13:47,090 --> 01:13:48,723
Can't you hear
how far away that is?

1698
01:13:48,725 --> 01:13:50,458
We've got at least 30 seconds
until they're here.

1699
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:52,093
How am I gonna
explain this to my parents?

1700
01:13:52,095 --> 01:13:53,361
Oh, my god.
My lisp is back!

1701
01:13:53,363 --> 01:13:54,929
-20 seconds.
-Oh!

1702
01:13:54,931 --> 01:13:56,664
Just run! Run!

1703
01:14:18,321 --> 01:14:20,922
Jason!

1704
01:14:20,924 --> 01:14:22,156
Open the door!

1705
01:14:25,228 --> 01:14:28,663
Jason! Open the door!

1706
01:14:28,665 --> 01:14:30,731
Open the fucking door!

1707
01:14:30,733 --> 01:14:32,166
Whoa!
Whoa, okay!

1708
01:14:32,168 --> 01:14:33,668
Okay!

1709
01:14:35,104 --> 01:14:37,338
Hold on! I'm not in!
I'm not in! I'm not in!

1710
01:14:37,340 --> 01:14:38,840
I'm in.

1711
01:14:41,444 --> 01:14:42,743
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

1712
01:14:45,281 --> 01:14:47,748
You are a crazy son of a bitch.
You know that, right?

1713
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:49,317
I didn't, actually.

1714
01:14:49,319 --> 01:14:51,118
I'm sure my blood pressure
was through the roof.

1715
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:52,987
But it was worth it.
Good times!

1716
01:14:52,989 --> 01:14:55,189
Guys, I can't --

1717
01:14:55,191 --> 01:14:58,159
I literally can't thank you
enough for what you just did.

1718
01:14:58,161 --> 01:15:02,196
It was so above and beyond
and brave and loyal.

1719
01:15:02,198 --> 01:15:03,831
I am indebted to you
forever.

1720
01:15:03,833 --> 01:15:05,099
-No, you're not.
-Well, you're very welcome.

1721
01:15:05,101 --> 01:15:06,300
You know...

1722
01:15:06,302 --> 01:15:09,270
Takes a team,
but it's done.

1723
01:15:09,272 --> 01:15:12,039
-All taken care of.
-Okay.

1724
01:15:12,041 --> 01:15:14,041
I'm gonna have another.
Anybody else?

1725
01:15:14,043 --> 01:15:15,476
-I would love that.
-Yeah, let's do that.

1726
01:15:15,478 --> 01:15:18,112
Yeah. But could I just get
a half this time?

1727
01:15:18,114 --> 01:15:19,213
I'll take his half.

1728
01:15:19,215 --> 01:15:20,681
We'll all
have doubles.

1729
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:24,952
N-no, it's okay. I can drink.
It's a thing about me.

1730
01:15:24,954 --> 01:15:26,320
Now, what are your names,
again?

1731
01:15:26,322 --> 01:15:27,655
I never
want to not know you.

1732
01:15:27,657 --> 01:15:29,123
I'm Jason.

1733
01:15:29,125 --> 01:15:31,225
I've worked for you
for like a year.

1734
01:15:31,227 --> 01:15:33,127
I've delivered things
to your home.

1735
01:15:33,129 --> 01:15:34,495
I met Matt
a bunch of times.

1736
01:15:34,497 --> 01:15:36,464
I've tied your daughter's shoe
before.

1737
01:15:36,466 --> 01:15:38,366
I -- I know who you are.
I'm just terrible with names.

1738
01:15:38,368 --> 01:15:40,034
It's all right.
It's Jason.

1739
01:15:40,036 --> 01:15:41,068
You're new, right?

1740
01:15:41,070 --> 01:15:42,470
Yeah.
I'm Davis.

1741
01:15:42,472 --> 01:15:44,205
I started work
the same day as Ben.

1742
01:15:44,207 --> 01:15:46,374
We're pretty much besties,
and I'm his mentee.

1743
01:15:46,376 --> 01:15:48,376
Oh.
He gave me this tie,
for example.

1744
01:15:48,378 --> 01:15:50,011
It was his.
It's vintage.

1745
01:15:50,013 --> 01:15:51,846
-"Vintage."
-I like it.

1746
01:15:51,848 --> 01:15:53,247
I like men in ties.

1747
01:15:53,249 --> 01:15:55,149
-And, you're Lewis.
-Yes.

1748
01:15:55,151 --> 01:15:56,751
Yeah, I could hear a little bit
over the phone.

1749
01:15:56,753 --> 01:15:58,352
You were very cool
under pressure.

1750
01:15:58,354 --> 01:16:00,588
Well, it was my first heist.
I tried to be chill.

1751
01:16:00,590 --> 01:16:01,722
Thanks for noticing.

1752
01:16:01,724 --> 01:16:03,491
<i> Salut.</i>

1753
01:16:03,493 --> 01:16:04,659
-Mm!
-Whoo!

1754
01:16:04,661 --> 01:16:07,161
Boys, what can I say...

1755
01:16:07,163 --> 01:16:08,429
I'm sorry.

1756
01:16:08,431 --> 01:16:10,097
I didn't mean
to call you "boys."

1757
01:16:10,099 --> 01:16:11,899
Nobody calls men
"men" anymore.

1758
01:16:11,901 --> 01:16:13,234
Have you noticed?

1759
01:16:13,236 --> 01:16:14,735
Women went from "girls"
to "women."

1760
01:16:14,737 --> 01:16:16,270
Men went from "men"
to "boys"?

1761
01:16:16,272 --> 01:16:18,673
This is a problem
in the big picture.

1762
01:16:18,675 --> 01:16:20,908
-Do you know what I mean?
-Yeah.

1763
01:16:20,910 --> 01:16:22,343
I'm gonna have another.

1764
01:16:22,345 --> 01:16:23,844
Another?
You sure about that?

1765
01:16:23,846 --> 01:16:26,547
Yep. Okay,
here's my theory about this.

1766
01:16:26,549 --> 01:16:29,016
We all grew up during
the "take your daughter
to work day" thing, right?

1767
01:16:29,018 --> 01:16:30,718
Mm-hmm.

1768
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:33,854
So we were always told we could
be anything, do anything.

1769
01:16:33,856 --> 01:16:36,724
And I think guys got,
maybe not left behind,

1770
01:16:36,726 --> 01:16:38,593
but not quite as nurtured,
you know?

1771
01:16:38,595 --> 01:16:41,596
I mean, like, we were the
generation of "you go, girl."

1772
01:16:41,598 --> 01:16:43,598
We had Oprah.

1773
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:46,767
And I wonder sometimes
how guys fit in, you know?

1774
01:16:46,769 --> 01:16:48,436
They still seem to be
trying to figure it out.

1775
01:16:48,438 --> 01:16:50,104
They're still dressing
like little boys.

1776
01:16:50,106 --> 01:16:51,639
They're still playing
video games.

1777
01:16:51,641 --> 01:16:53,407
Well, they've gotten great.
So...

1778
01:16:53,409 --> 01:16:55,242
I love video games.

1779
01:16:55,244 --> 01:16:56,877
Oh, boy.

1780
01:16:56,879 --> 01:16:59,146
How, in one generation,
have men gone from

1781
01:16:59,148 --> 01:17:02,984
guys like Jack Nicholson
and Harrison Ford to...

1782
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:08,389
Take Ben, here.

1783
01:17:08,391 --> 01:17:10,324
A dying breed.
You know?

1784
01:17:10,326 --> 01:17:11,826
Look and learn, boys,

1785
01:17:11,828 --> 01:17:14,261
because if you ask me,
this is what cool is.

1786
01:17:14,263 --> 01:17:16,597
Oh, thanks, Ace. You're not
gonna drink anymore, right?

1787
01:17:16,599 --> 01:17:18,766
Calling me "Ace"?

1788
01:17:18,768 --> 01:17:20,401
That is just super cool,
right?

1789
01:17:20,403 --> 01:17:21,769
-Definitely.
-Very cool.

1790
01:17:21,771 --> 01:17:24,505
Okay.
I am officially a little dizzy.

1791
01:17:24,507 --> 01:17:26,307
I apologize for the tirade.

1792
01:17:26,309 --> 01:17:28,976
I am gonna go.

1793
01:17:28,978 --> 01:17:33,314
But I am forever in your debt,
gentlemen.

1794
01:17:33,316 --> 01:17:35,783
Another word
which is never used anymore.

1795
01:17:35,785 --> 01:17:37,652
Let's bring it back,
shall we?

1796
01:17:37,654 --> 01:17:41,355
-Yes.
-Ben, I'll be ubering home.

1797
01:17:41,357 --> 01:17:42,757
-Thanks again.
-Whoa! Whoa!

1798
01:17:42,759 --> 01:17:43,791
Okay.

1799
01:17:43,793 --> 01:17:46,093
I'm so sorry.

1800
01:17:46,095 --> 01:17:47,762
Don't worry.

1801
01:17:47,764 --> 01:17:50,431
I'm fine now.

1802
01:17:50,433 --> 01:17:52,166
Okay.

1803
01:17:52,168 --> 01:17:53,701
It's okay, it's okay.

1804
01:17:56,472 --> 01:17:59,240
Oh, I haven't done that
since college.

1805
01:18:02,944 --> 01:18:04,945
Thank you.

1806
01:18:04,947 --> 01:18:07,815
Oh, man.

1807
01:18:07,817 --> 01:18:10,518
Very sorry
you had to see that.

1808
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:11,819
Humiliating.

1809
01:18:11,821 --> 01:18:13,120
It's all good.

1810
01:18:13,122 --> 01:18:14,889
You feeling better?

1811
01:18:14,891 --> 01:18:16,624
Yeah.

1812
01:18:16,626 --> 01:18:20,061
Yeah, I forgot you got to eat
before you drink.

1813
01:18:21,997 --> 01:18:23,330
I'm good now.

1814
01:18:23,332 --> 01:18:25,733
Thank you.

1815
01:18:34,009 --> 01:18:36,744
I'm leaving
in a minute.

1816
01:18:36,746 --> 01:18:40,214
Just working on making this
the worst possible day for you.

1817
01:18:40,216 --> 01:18:42,917
No, not at all.
You've had a stressful day.

1818
01:18:47,422 --> 01:18:51,559
How is it that you always
manage to say the right thing...

1819
01:18:51,561 --> 01:18:54,595
Do the right thing,
be the right thing?

1820
01:18:54,597 --> 01:18:56,931
It's uncanny.

1821
01:18:56,933 --> 01:18:58,566
You --
you get some rest.

1822
01:18:58,568 --> 01:18:59,934
I will.

1823
01:18:59,936 --> 01:19:01,635
Thanks for everything.

1824
01:19:06,341 --> 01:19:08,943
Oh, and, uh...

1825
01:19:08,945 --> 01:19:11,412
<i> Sayonara.</i>

1826
01:19:11,414 --> 01:19:14,048
Absolutely.

1827
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:29,296
Really so nice of you
to do this.

1828
01:19:29,298 --> 01:19:31,031
Most women would have
just rescheduled.

1829
01:19:31,033 --> 01:19:33,801
Oh, not to worry.
I understand.

1830
01:19:33,803 --> 01:19:36,270
It was unexpected.

1831
01:19:36,272 --> 01:19:37,605
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1832
01:19:37,607 --> 01:19:38,973
You're welcome.

1833
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:48,716
-Hi.
-Oh. Come on in.

1834
01:19:48,718 --> 01:19:50,951
Oh, no, after you.
Go ahead.

1835
01:19:53,622 --> 01:19:56,991
Benji, you brought a date
to a funeral. Unreal.

1836
01:19:56,993 --> 01:19:59,226
We had plans.
Who knew this was gonna happen?

1837
01:19:59,228 --> 01:20:01,128
Well, how do you do?
I'm miles.

1838
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:02,496
Hello. Fiona.

1839
01:20:02,498 --> 01:20:03,964
I'm so sorry
for your loss.

1840
01:20:03,966 --> 01:20:06,967
Oh, thank you, dear.

1841
01:20:06,969 --> 01:20:08,636
Wowza!

1842
01:20:43,672 --> 01:20:45,840
I never went to
a Shiva before.

1843
01:20:45,842 --> 01:20:47,441
The laughter
was wonderful.

1844
01:20:47,443 --> 01:20:49,143
I don't think
I've ever eaten more.

1845
01:20:49,145 --> 01:20:51,812
I'm not even sure how I left
with a box of cookies.

1846
01:20:51,814 --> 01:20:53,514
Well,
you were a big hit.

1847
01:20:53,516 --> 01:20:56,283
Giving the widow that
back massage -- winning move.

1848
01:20:56,285 --> 01:20:58,352
Oh, yeah.
She needed it.

1849
01:20:58,354 --> 01:20:59,820
I definitely think
it's a good idea

1850
01:20:59,822 --> 01:21:01,956
to take all first dates
to a funeral.

1851
01:21:01,958 --> 01:21:04,158
Yeah. A real icebreaker,
don't you think?

1852
01:21:05,394 --> 01:21:07,027
I know you're kidding
but, honestly,

1853
01:21:07,029 --> 01:21:09,163
who needs the strain
of the dinner date?

1854
01:21:09,165 --> 01:21:11,365
And the "why aren't you
married?" Conversation.

1855
01:21:11,367 --> 01:21:15,202
At our age it's not even
possible to catch up.

1856
01:21:15,204 --> 01:21:18,239
Well, I can do me
in 10 seconds.

1857
01:21:19,507 --> 01:21:21,242
You ready?
Yep.

1858
01:21:21,244 --> 01:21:24,011
Widower,
one son, two grandkids.

1859
01:21:24,013 --> 01:21:26,180
Spent my life
manufacturing phonebooks,

1860
01:21:26,182 --> 01:21:27,481
which no longer
serve a purpose.

1861
01:21:28,718 --> 01:21:30,251
I'm currently working
as an intern,

1862
01:21:30,253 --> 01:21:32,386
having a ball.

1863
01:21:32,388 --> 01:21:36,390
And the best news is, I have
a crush on a girl I met at work.

1864
01:21:36,392 --> 01:21:39,526
I'm sorry
you lost your wife.

1865
01:21:39,528 --> 01:21:40,561
Okay.

1866
01:21:40,563 --> 01:21:42,029
Divorced.

1867
01:21:42,031 --> 01:21:43,664
Three beautiful daughters.

1868
01:21:43,666 --> 01:21:46,600
One grandchild, a boy,
on the way.

1869
01:21:46,602 --> 01:21:48,035
I was sick
a few years back.

1870
01:21:48,037 --> 01:21:49,336
I'm not anymore.

1871
01:21:49,338 --> 01:21:51,739
I'm an in-house
e-commerce masseuse.

1872
01:21:51,741 --> 01:21:53,374
Love my job.

1873
01:21:53,376 --> 01:21:58,012
And I finally met a man i
actually want to hang out with.

1874
01:21:58,014 --> 01:22:00,848
Lucky me.

1875
01:22:16,064 --> 01:22:17,298
Morning.

1876
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:19,066
Hey, buddy.
You don't look so great.

1877
01:22:19,068 --> 01:22:20,868
Yeah, I know.

1878
01:22:20,870 --> 01:22:24,138
But believe me,
i look better than I feel.

1879
01:22:24,140 --> 01:22:25,439
Oh, did you see the Yankees
last night?

1880
01:22:25,441 --> 01:22:27,908
-Oh, they were on fire.
-Oh, man.

1881
01:22:27,910 --> 01:22:29,777
Jules: Got to get something
in your stomach.

1882
01:22:29,779 --> 01:22:31,312
Honey, honey, honey.

1883
01:22:31,314 --> 01:22:33,380
Just can you please take
one bite before school?

1884
01:22:33,382 --> 01:22:34,882
Please?
Just one bite?

1885
01:22:34,884 --> 01:22:37,418
Hey, what's with the waterworks,
little one?

1886
01:22:37,420 --> 01:22:38,752
I just told her that
the sitter's gonna have to

1887
01:22:38,754 --> 01:22:40,087
take her to
maddie's birthday party

1888
01:22:40,089 --> 01:22:41,422
because
Matt's feeling sick.

1889
01:22:41,424 --> 01:22:45,125
But I don't want to go
with the sitter.

1890
01:22:45,127 --> 01:22:46,293
Ben?

1891
01:22:46,295 --> 01:22:48,729
Can you take me?

1892
01:22:48,731 --> 01:22:50,397
Please?

1893
01:22:50,399 --> 01:22:51,999
Oh, honey?

1894
01:22:52,001 --> 01:22:55,336
I'm so sorry, but Ben's
got to go to work today.

1895
01:22:58,074 --> 01:22:59,907
Jules. Come on.
It'll take an hour.

1896
01:22:59,909 --> 01:23:01,742
Let me take her.

1897
01:23:04,579 --> 01:23:06,613
Ben: I -- I can't believe
we're still going through this.

1898
01:23:06,615 --> 01:23:09,483
I'm going the right way.
Please have a little trust.

1899
01:23:09,485 --> 01:23:11,452
But the park
where the party is...

1900
01:23:11,454 --> 01:23:13,320
Oh. Sorry, Ben.

1901
01:23:13,322 --> 01:23:16,190
Actually, this is it.

1902
01:23:16,192 --> 01:23:18,292
You're like a clone.

1903
01:23:18,294 --> 01:23:21,295
Oh, boy.
This looks like a nice party.

1904
01:23:21,297 --> 01:23:23,430
Yeah, it does.

1905
01:23:23,432 --> 01:23:24,865
So which one is maddie?

1906
01:23:24,867 --> 01:23:27,134
The one in the pink.

1907
01:23:27,136 --> 01:23:29,570
Okay.
The one in the pink.

1908
01:23:31,339 --> 01:23:34,008
You can go sit with
the other moms, okay?

1909
01:23:34,010 --> 01:23:36,110
Okay. You want to
give maddie her present?

1910
01:23:36,112 --> 01:23:38,178
Yeah.
Okay.

1911
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:40,547
Have fun.

1912
01:23:42,450 --> 01:23:43,617
The other moms.

1913
01:23:44,886 --> 01:23:46,453
Frep-- freprino
or something.

1914
01:23:46,455 --> 01:23:47,988
Yeah, I know.
I don't know any of them.

1915
01:23:47,990 --> 01:23:49,690
Hi. I'm Ben.

1916
01:23:49,692 --> 01:23:50,791
-Hi. Jane.
-Jane.

1917
01:23:50,793 --> 01:23:52,326
-And Emily.
-Hi, Emily.

1918
01:23:52,328 --> 01:23:53,827
I'm helping Matt and Jules out
today.

1919
01:23:53,829 --> 01:23:55,295
Oh, are you Matt's dad?

1920
01:23:55,297 --> 01:23:57,331
No, no.
I work for Jules.

1921
01:23:57,333 --> 01:23:58,632
Oh.

1922
01:23:58,634 --> 01:24:00,334
That's okay?

1923
01:24:00,336 --> 01:24:03,971
I've just heard she's,
you know, kind of tough.

1924
01:24:03,973 --> 01:24:06,507
Tough? Jules? Sure.
She's a total badass.

1925
01:24:06,509 --> 01:24:09,243
I guess that's how she became
an Internet sensation.

1926
01:24:09,245 --> 01:24:11,078
Must make you guys proud,
huh?

1927
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:12,579
One of your own out there
every day,

1928
01:24:12,581 --> 01:24:14,748
crashing the glass ceiling
of the tech world.

1929
01:24:14,750 --> 01:24:17,885
So, bravo, good for her.
Right?

1930
01:24:17,887 --> 01:24:19,887
Y-yeah.
No, for sure.

1931
01:24:21,424 --> 01:24:22,723
What's up, kiddo?

1932
01:24:22,725 --> 01:24:24,191
I don't feel good.

1933
01:24:24,193 --> 01:24:27,227
You don't?
Do you want to sit on my lap?

1934
01:24:27,229 --> 01:24:30,431
You know, if she's sick
she probably shouldn't be here.

1935
01:24:30,433 --> 01:24:33,400
Tough crowd, paigey.
You want to hit the road?

1936
01:24:33,402 --> 01:24:34,835
Does that mean "leave"?

1937
01:24:34,837 --> 01:24:36,136
'Fraid so.

1938
01:24:38,173 --> 01:24:43,844
Paige: I spy with my little eye
something...Blue!

1939
01:24:43,846 --> 01:24:45,746
Ben:
Is it the car next to us?

1940
01:24:45,748 --> 01:24:47,114
No.

1941
01:24:47,116 --> 01:24:49,783
Is it, um,
that dog leash?

1942
01:24:49,785 --> 01:24:51,518
No.

1943
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:53,353
Um, is it the sky?

1944
01:24:53,355 --> 01:24:55,055
Yes! You got one.

1945
01:24:55,057 --> 01:24:56,256
Your turn, Ben.

1946
01:24:56,258 --> 01:24:57,958
Okay.

1947
01:24:57,960 --> 01:24:59,593
Oh, I have a good one.

1948
01:24:59,595 --> 01:25:03,030
I spy with my little eye
something green.

1949
01:25:03,032 --> 01:25:04,631
Is it that tree?

1950
01:25:04,633 --> 01:25:05,966
Nope.

1951
01:25:05,968 --> 01:25:07,901
Is it that front door?

1952
01:25:07,903 --> 01:25:10,170
Well, it's kind of green.

1953
01:25:25,653 --> 01:25:27,488
Is it, Ben?

1954
01:25:27,490 --> 01:25:29,790
Is it that front door?

1955
01:25:32,393 --> 01:25:34,995
Yeah, it is, honey.
Good girl.

1956
01:26:48,203 --> 01:26:50,304
Thanks so much, Ben.

1957
01:27:06,321 --> 01:27:07,854
Hey,
come on in the kitchen.

1958
01:27:07,856 --> 01:27:09,590
Can I get you something
before you hit the road?

1959
01:27:09,592 --> 01:27:12,259
Want a cup of coffee
or a bite to eat?

1960
01:27:12,261 --> 01:27:13,927
Uh, I'm good, thanks.

1961
01:27:13,929 --> 01:27:16,563
Okay. How was she?
She give you any trouble?

1962
01:27:16,565 --> 01:27:18,232
She was perfect.

1963
01:27:18,234 --> 01:27:20,434
She wasn't feeling so great
at the party, so we left early,

1964
01:27:20,436 --> 01:27:24,271
and she just fell asleep in the
car, so I let her get a nap in.

1965
01:27:24,273 --> 01:27:25,872
So nice of you.
Thank you.

1966
01:27:27,176 --> 01:27:28,342
Sorry.

1967
01:27:32,714 --> 01:27:34,715
You seem like
you're feeling more with it.

1968
01:27:34,717 --> 01:27:36,516
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Um...

1969
01:27:36,518 --> 01:27:38,518
I guess I just needed
a little downtime.

1970
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:42,422
You know, or maybe I wasn't even
that sick, I don't know.

1971
01:27:42,424 --> 01:27:45,259
Hey, Ben, I got something
i wanted to ask.

1972
01:27:45,261 --> 01:27:48,128
What's your whole take
on the ceo thing?

1973
01:27:48,130 --> 01:27:50,897
I mean, you're more
on the inside than I am.

1974
01:27:50,899 --> 01:27:53,867
I know Jules is trying to
do right by everybody --

1975
01:27:53,869 --> 01:27:55,602
the investors.

1976
01:27:55,604 --> 01:27:57,037
The company.

1977
01:27:57,039 --> 01:27:58,038
You.

1978
01:27:59,774 --> 01:28:01,208
She's got a lot
on her shoulders.

1979
01:28:01,210 --> 01:28:03,310
The pressure
is unbelievable.

1980
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:10,484
Am I wrong
that I want it to happen?

1981
01:28:10,486 --> 01:28:12,719
I mean,
i-i want what she wants,

1982
01:28:12,721 --> 01:28:15,455
but you know what it's like
around here.

1983
01:28:15,457 --> 01:28:18,425
We don't see her enough,
and maybe this can fix that.

1984
01:28:18,427 --> 01:28:21,628
A ceo's gonna fix
what's going on here, Matt?

1985
01:28:24,966 --> 01:28:28,568
Whatever she decides, I just --
i want it to be good for her.

1986
01:28:28,570 --> 01:28:31,071
I want her to be happy.

1987
01:28:32,807 --> 01:28:34,308
Of course.

1988
01:28:34,310 --> 01:28:37,010
She deserves that.

1989
01:28:38,012 --> 01:28:41,581
Yeah,
she does deserve it.

1990
01:28:49,123 --> 01:28:51,091
Hi, Amy.

1991
01:28:56,964 --> 01:28:58,965
Benjamin,
what do you think?

1992
01:28:58,967 --> 01:29:00,267
Found it on ebay.

1993
01:29:00,269 --> 01:29:01,768
You were right.
Total classic.

1994
01:29:01,770 --> 01:29:02,803
It's awesome, kid.

1995
01:29:29,664 --> 01:29:31,131
So, how did it go?

1996
01:29:31,133 --> 01:29:33,066
Oh. Well, you have a great kid,
Jules.

1997
01:29:33,068 --> 01:29:34,568
She's adorable.

1998
01:29:34,570 --> 01:29:37,637
Oh, thank you so much
for doing that.

1999
01:29:37,639 --> 01:29:40,073
So, you excited about our trip
to San Francisco tomorrow?

2000
01:29:41,509 --> 01:29:43,977
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

2001
01:29:45,346 --> 01:29:47,481
Oh, I hope you don't have
what Matt has.

2002
01:29:47,483 --> 01:29:48,482
I don't.

2003
01:29:48,484 --> 01:29:49,483
You sure?

2004
01:29:49,485 --> 01:29:50,617
Positive.

2005
01:29:52,420 --> 01:29:53,653
What's that?

2006
01:29:53,655 --> 01:29:54,654
Blood pressure.

2007
01:29:54,656 --> 01:29:56,656
I take it every day.

2008
01:29:56,658 --> 01:29:59,226
Are you sure
you're okay?
Yeah.

2009
01:29:59,228 --> 01:30:01,495
You don't look like you.
You're all flushed.

2010
01:30:01,497 --> 01:30:03,397
Why don't you go see Fiona,
the masseuse,

2011
01:30:03,399 --> 01:30:05,031
and just chill a little.

2012
01:30:05,033 --> 01:30:06,032
What's up?

2013
01:30:06,034 --> 01:30:07,934
Whoa, Ben, you okay?

2014
01:30:07,936 --> 01:30:10,737
You seem to be
slightly malfunctioning.

2015
01:30:10,739 --> 01:30:13,006
Becky.
Does he look right to you?

2016
01:30:13,008 --> 01:30:14,841
Okay. Thank you.

2017
01:30:14,843 --> 01:30:16,109
I think we're good here.

2018
01:30:16,111 --> 01:30:17,544
Got a lot of work to do.

2019
01:30:17,546 --> 01:30:19,246
It's all good.

2020
01:30:19,248 --> 01:30:21,415
Is it his coloring?

2021
01:30:21,417 --> 01:30:22,549
Oh, my god,
you're all nuts.

2022
01:30:22,551 --> 01:30:24,017
I'm 100%.
Let's move on, kids.

2023
01:30:24,019 --> 01:30:25,786
Big day. Lots to do.

2024
01:30:25,788 --> 01:30:28,388
Okay. Ben...

2025
01:30:28,390 --> 01:30:30,857
If I am giving you too much to
do or working you too hard,

2026
01:30:30,859 --> 01:30:33,293
please do not feel that you have
to go with me to San Francisco.

2027
01:30:33,295 --> 01:30:35,395
Jules, people my age
get tired sometimes.

2028
01:30:35,397 --> 01:30:36,730
That's all this is.

2029
01:30:36,732 --> 01:30:38,565
You're tired?

2030
01:30:38,567 --> 01:30:40,634
That's why you haven't looked at
me once since I came over here?

2031
01:30:42,236 --> 01:30:43,703
I'm looking at you.

2032
01:30:46,441 --> 01:30:48,775
Jules.
Cameron's on the phone.

2033
01:30:48,777 --> 01:30:50,444
Okay.

2034
01:30:50,446 --> 01:30:53,480
Like, if you don't feel better
tonight or late--

2035
01:30:53,482 --> 01:30:55,982
I'm just saying
i can go by myself, okay?

2036
01:30:55,984 --> 01:30:58,552
I'm a big girl.
I'll be fine.

2037
01:31:07,829 --> 01:31:09,930
Okay, seriously?

2038
01:31:09,932 --> 01:31:11,631
Ben, what is it?

2039
01:31:11,633 --> 01:31:14,134
You know,
I'm a sensitive man.

2040
01:31:14,136 --> 01:31:15,402
People don't
think that about me.

2041
01:31:15,404 --> 01:31:16,903
I don't look it,
but I am.

2042
01:31:16,905 --> 01:31:19,172
Under all this man stuff
that you so admire...

2043
01:31:19,174 --> 01:31:22,175
Mm-hmm.
...I'm just
a big bowl of mush.

2044
01:31:22,177 --> 01:31:24,110
I know that.

2045
01:31:24,112 --> 01:31:25,679
Okay.

2046
01:31:27,348 --> 01:31:29,015
That's it?

2047
01:31:29,017 --> 01:31:31,518
That's what
24 hours of crazy comes to?

2048
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:33,787
That you're
a sensitive bowl of mush?

2049
01:31:33,789 --> 01:31:36,990
Jules.

2050
01:31:36,992 --> 01:31:38,758
Ben.

2051
01:31:40,795 --> 01:31:42,829
Jules,
what are we doing here?

2052
01:31:42,831 --> 01:31:44,831
We got the day off.
We're traveling in first-class.

2053
01:31:44,833 --> 01:31:46,366
Let's at least
have a little fun.

2054
01:31:46,368 --> 01:31:49,035
Now, that, I can do.

2055
01:32:16,130 --> 01:32:18,965
Woman:<i> Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i> as we start our descent,</i>

2056
01:32:18,967 --> 01:32:21,201
<i> please make sure your seat</i>
<i> backs and tray tables</i>

2057
01:32:21,203 --> 01:32:22,802
<i> are in their full,</i>
<i> upright positions</i>

2058
01:32:22,804 --> 01:32:25,071
<i> and all carryon luggage</i>
<i> is stowed</i>

2059
01:32:25,073 --> 01:32:26,873
<i> under the seat</i>
<i> in front of you.</i>

2060
01:32:26,875 --> 01:32:28,141
You okay?

2061
01:32:28,143 --> 01:32:29,409
Yeah.

2062
01:32:29,411 --> 01:32:31,077
Just thinking,
tomorrow I meet the guy

2063
01:32:31,079 --> 01:32:32,979
who may become
my boss, kind of.

2064
01:32:32,981 --> 01:32:34,981
I mean a lot of people
have bosses, right?

2065
01:32:34,983 --> 01:32:37,584
-Most people have bosses.
-Jules, it's simple.

2066
01:32:37,586 --> 01:32:39,553
If you think townsend
is gonna be good for you

2067
01:32:39,555 --> 01:32:41,054
and good for the company,
then do it.

2068
01:32:41,056 --> 01:32:42,055
And if not...

2069
01:32:42,057 --> 01:32:43,223
Exactly.

2070
01:32:43,225 --> 01:32:45,058
Just because
i came all way here...

2071
01:32:45,060 --> 01:32:46,927
Right.
Doesn't mean anything.

2072
01:32:46,929 --> 01:32:48,495
I agree.

2073
01:32:50,431 --> 01:32:51,998
Do you think
i can take a Xanax

2074
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,234
if I had two glasses of wine
an hour ago?

2075
01:32:54,236 --> 01:32:56,503
Well, I'd wait
another couple hours.

2076
01:33:01,909 --> 01:33:05,412
It's a thing I do before I land.
We're good now.

2077
01:33:16,858 --> 01:33:18,358
-Jules?
-Yeah.

2078
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:20,126
-You hear that?
-Uh-huh. I hear it. I'm up.

2079
01:33:37,912 --> 01:33:38,912
Are you okay?

2080
01:33:38,914 --> 01:33:40,213
This alarm going off

2081
01:33:40,215 --> 01:33:41,881
is not a good omen
about this guy.

2082
01:33:41,883 --> 01:33:44,117
-It's a sign, Ben.
-Oh, I'm pretty sure it's not.

2083
01:33:44,119 --> 01:33:45,752
So you haven't
taken a Xanax, yet?

2084
01:33:45,754 --> 01:33:48,121
You told me
to wait a few hours.

2085
01:33:48,123 --> 01:33:49,789
You travel
with your own robe?

2086
01:33:49,791 --> 01:33:51,658
Yeah.

2087
01:33:51,660 --> 01:33:53,126
Hotel manager:
Ladies and gentlemen,

2088
01:33:53,128 --> 01:33:55,328
a smoke alarm went off
in one of the rooms,

2089
01:33:55,330 --> 01:33:57,163
but the problem
has been taken care of.

2090
01:33:57,165 --> 01:33:58,398
Our sincerest apologies.

2091
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:00,266
Oh, yeah.
100 people, 2 elevators.

2092
01:34:00,268 --> 01:34:02,569
Definitely a sign.

2093
01:34:05,007 --> 01:34:06,606
Well,
thanks for escorting me back.

2094
01:34:06,608 --> 01:34:07,841
Mm-hmm.

2095
01:34:11,412 --> 01:34:13,580
You want to see my room?

2096
01:34:13,582 --> 01:34:14,948
Oh, nice.

2097
01:34:14,950 --> 01:34:17,617
I mean,
do you actually want to come in?

2098
01:34:17,619 --> 01:34:20,987
I have a tea kettle.
We could have tea or...

2099
01:34:23,291 --> 01:34:25,825
I'm ridiculously nervous
about tomorrow.

2100
01:34:30,331 --> 01:34:31,765
You can lie down.

2101
01:34:31,767 --> 01:34:33,733
I know you're tired.
I'll sit in the chair.

2102
01:34:45,479 --> 01:34:46,846
Here you go.

2103
01:34:51,018 --> 01:34:52,786
I thought you were gonna
sit in a chair?

2104
01:34:52,788 --> 01:34:56,556
Please let me be here.
I need to lie down, too.

2105
01:34:58,059 --> 01:35:00,160
We don't have to talk about work
or anything.

2106
01:35:00,162 --> 01:35:03,863
All right.
What should we talk about?

2107
01:35:03,865 --> 01:35:06,066
Marriage?

2108
01:35:08,736 --> 01:35:11,571
Will you tell me
about your wife?

2109
01:35:11,573 --> 01:35:13,173
She was great, right?

2110
01:35:13,175 --> 01:35:15,175
She was.

2111
01:35:15,177 --> 01:35:17,844
Molly was her name.

2112
01:35:17,846 --> 01:35:20,413
She was
a middle-school principal.

2113
01:35:20,415 --> 01:35:21,681
Beloved.

2114
01:35:21,683 --> 01:35:23,483
So perfect.

2115
01:35:23,485 --> 01:35:26,052
Long marriage?

2116
01:35:26,054 --> 01:35:27,654
Not long enough.

2117
01:35:27,656 --> 01:35:29,089
42 years.

2118
01:35:29,091 --> 01:35:31,891
Wow.
What was that like?

2119
01:35:31,893 --> 01:35:34,427
You know when people say
they want to grow old together?

2120
01:35:34,429 --> 01:35:37,230
-Mm-hmm.
-Well, we did that.

2121
01:35:37,232 --> 01:35:38,598
We met when we were 20.

2122
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:41,401
Well, I was 20.
She was 19.

2123
01:35:41,403 --> 01:35:44,938
And what was amazing
is she never really changed.

2124
01:35:44,940 --> 01:35:47,674
That's a hard thing
to pull off.

2125
01:35:47,676 --> 01:35:49,876
She handled life
like it was easy.

2126
01:35:49,878 --> 01:35:51,711
Always.

2127
01:35:51,713 --> 01:35:54,581
Even when it wasn't.

2128
01:35:55,883 --> 01:35:57,617
God, I envy that.

2129
01:36:00,454 --> 01:36:01,621
Are you hungry?

2130
01:36:03,891 --> 01:36:05,892
We have, um...

2131
01:36:05,894 --> 01:36:09,129
Gummy bears, chocolate chips,
pringles.

2132
01:36:09,131 --> 01:36:10,430
Yup.

2133
01:36:10,432 --> 01:36:12,866
I'm just gonna bring
the whole thing.

2134
01:36:12,868 --> 01:36:15,935
You know those are
like 15 bucks each?

2135
01:36:15,937 --> 01:36:18,605
Benjamin, I run a very big
Internet company.

2136
01:36:18,607 --> 01:36:21,207
Let's go crazy.

2137
01:36:21,209 --> 01:36:23,443
Okay.

2138
01:36:23,445 --> 01:36:24,878
So...

2139
01:36:26,814 --> 01:36:29,249
So...

2140
01:36:29,251 --> 01:36:31,117
Yeah, so...

2141
01:36:33,220 --> 01:36:35,822
I got a weird one
for you.

2142
01:36:38,626 --> 01:36:40,727
Matt is cheating on me.

2143
01:36:42,596 --> 01:36:44,764
Wait a minute.
You know about this?

2144
01:36:44,766 --> 01:36:46,833
What does that mean?

2145
01:36:46,835 --> 01:36:48,468
Wait,
you know about this?

2146
01:36:50,104 --> 01:36:52,005
I saw them together.

2147
01:36:52,007 --> 01:36:54,073
Oh, my god. When?

2148
01:36:54,075 --> 01:36:56,810
Yesterday.

2149
01:36:56,812 --> 01:36:58,344
I'm -- I'm sorry.

2150
01:36:58,346 --> 01:37:01,481
I mean, it was an accident
that I saw them, but I did.

2151
01:37:01,483 --> 01:37:04,150
Yesterday.

2152
01:37:04,152 --> 01:37:06,352
Then it is
still going on.

2153
01:37:08,122 --> 01:37:09,923
How long have you known?

2154
01:37:09,925 --> 01:37:12,692
For like 18 days.

2155
01:37:12,694 --> 01:37:14,594
She's a mom
at Paige's school.

2156
01:37:15,930 --> 01:37:17,463
It's still so hard
for me to grasp.

2157
01:37:17,465 --> 01:37:19,666
I-i was in the kitchen
making sandwiches,

2158
01:37:19,668 --> 01:37:21,301
and his phone was there.

2159
01:37:21,303 --> 01:37:22,635
He was upstairs
with Paige,

2160
01:37:22,637 --> 01:37:24,370
and h-he was getting
all these text messages.

2161
01:37:24,372 --> 01:37:26,306
And I don't know why,
but I read them.

2162
01:37:26,308 --> 01:37:29,275
It was not good.

2163
01:37:29,277 --> 01:37:30,877
Does he know you know?

2164
01:37:30,879 --> 01:37:32,345
No.

2165
01:37:32,347 --> 01:37:34,981
'Cause, honestly, I'm --
I'm not ready...

2166
01:37:34,983 --> 01:37:36,482
To deal with it.

2167
01:37:36,484 --> 01:37:38,518
I would like to be
a little less devastated,

2168
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:40,053
if that is possible.

2169
01:37:41,355 --> 01:37:43,356
It's classic, though,
isn't it?

2170
01:37:43,358 --> 01:37:44,958
The successful wife.

2171
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:46,626
The husband feels like
his manhood is threatened,

2172
01:37:46,628 --> 01:37:48,528
so he acts out.

2173
01:37:48,530 --> 01:37:52,165
Girlfriend, I guess,
makes him feel more like a man.

2174
01:37:52,167 --> 01:37:55,568
Sometimes I'm not sure
i know how to do that.

2175
01:37:55,570 --> 01:37:57,470
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

2176
01:37:57,472 --> 01:37:59,806
You're not actually taking the
rap for any of this, are you?

2177
01:37:59,808 --> 01:38:02,041
No! No, no.

2178
01:38:02,043 --> 01:38:03,376
He is the one
doing something wrong.

2179
01:38:03,378 --> 01:38:04,677
I get that.

2180
01:38:04,679 --> 01:38:06,379
Monogam-ish
is not what I'm after.

2181
01:38:06,381 --> 01:38:09,649
I-I'm just --
I'm taking a sec...

2182
01:38:09,651 --> 01:38:12,652
And I'm hoping that it's just
a horrible lapse in judgment

2183
01:38:12,654 --> 01:38:14,187
and not, like, love.

2184
01:38:14,189 --> 01:38:17,490
And once
he moves through this,

2185
01:38:17,492 --> 01:38:20,260
we will eventually
be able to be okay again.

2186
01:38:20,262 --> 01:38:21,928
What do you think
about that?

2187
01:38:23,764 --> 01:38:26,099
Clearly you don't think
that's a possible thing.

2188
01:38:26,101 --> 01:38:28,735
-It -- it would be unusual.
-I get that.

2189
01:38:28,737 --> 01:38:32,672
I get not everybody
could do that, but...

2190
01:38:32,674 --> 01:38:35,208
Everybody's not us.

2191
01:38:35,210 --> 01:38:38,077
I have faith in us
because...

2192
01:38:38,079 --> 01:38:40,246
I believe
he still loves me.

2193
01:38:40,248 --> 01:38:44,083
And, you know, we've been
going through so much that...

2194
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:48,454
God, I wish your expressions
weren't so transparent.

2195
01:38:48,456 --> 01:38:51,791
Some couples do survive
these things, you know.

2196
01:38:51,793 --> 01:38:53,893
I googled it -- "staying
together after the affair."

2197
01:38:53,895 --> 01:38:56,296
And a lot of couples,
i mean, a lot stay together.

2198
01:38:56,298 --> 01:38:58,097
And anyway,
there is something to be said

2199
01:38:58,099 --> 01:38:59,532
about moving through it

2200
01:38:59,534 --> 01:39:02,902
and focusing on us
and not on the affair.

2201
01:39:02,904 --> 01:39:05,805
I don't want to
give up on him.

2202
01:39:05,807 --> 01:39:08,641
I know him,
and I know he knows better.

2203
01:39:09,977 --> 01:39:11,778
But I am only human,

2204
01:39:11,780 --> 01:39:15,214
and I am so mad at him.

2205
01:39:16,784 --> 01:39:18,618
You know, so much
has happened to us so fast.

2206
01:39:18,620 --> 01:39:20,920
I think...

2207
01:39:20,922 --> 01:39:22,455
Part of me
was even expecting this.

2208
01:39:22,457 --> 01:39:24,490
Like, you know, he was
the more successful one

2209
01:39:24,492 --> 01:39:26,459
-when we started out.
-No, I didn't know that.

2210
01:39:26,461 --> 01:39:28,728
Yeah, he was.
He was a rising star.

2211
01:39:28,730 --> 01:39:30,630
And he bowed out
so that I could do this.

2212
01:39:30,632 --> 01:39:32,832
He was amazing.

2213
01:39:32,834 --> 01:39:34,634
It was all his idea.

2214
01:39:35,903 --> 01:39:37,403
I'm sure that's why
I'm even considering

2215
01:39:37,405 --> 01:39:38,738
this whole ceo thing,

2216
01:39:38,740 --> 01:39:41,975
thinking maybe
someone else coming in

2217
01:39:41,977 --> 01:39:43,743
will help me
get my life back on track.

2218
01:39:43,745 --> 01:39:45,278
Okay, that --
that's it.

2219
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:47,347
I hate to be the feminist here,
between the two of us,

2220
01:39:47,349 --> 01:39:50,149
but you should be able to have
a huge career and be who you are

2221
01:39:50,151 --> 01:39:52,585
without having to accept that
your husband is having an affair

2222
01:39:52,587 --> 01:39:53,820
as some kind of payback.

2223
01:39:53,822 --> 01:39:55,021
Right on.

2224
01:39:55,023 --> 01:39:56,022
I mean it.

2225
01:39:56,024 --> 01:39:58,091
Me, too.

2226
01:39:58,093 --> 01:39:59,492
But such is life,
my friend.

2227
01:39:59,494 --> 01:40:00,960
No, it isn't.
Not always.

2228
01:40:00,962 --> 01:40:02,662
And I'm not so sure
I'd be so forgiving.

2229
01:40:02,664 --> 01:40:04,297
I am not so forgiving.

2230
01:40:04,299 --> 01:40:06,299
I'm saying that I could
potentially be forgiving.

2231
01:40:06,301 --> 01:40:08,935
But don't think that i
don't feel what's going on here.

2232
01:40:08,937 --> 01:40:10,970
It's crushing.

2233
01:40:10,972 --> 01:40:13,272
And when
i think of Paige...

2234
01:40:13,274 --> 01:40:15,274
Oh, don't.

2235
01:40:15,276 --> 01:40:19,345
Also, if we got divorced,
he'd remarry.

2236
01:40:19,347 --> 01:40:22,215
Maybe not to this girl,
but someone.

2237
01:40:25,019 --> 01:40:27,353
And we both know
I'm not easy.

2238
01:40:28,956 --> 01:40:32,325
So I could be, like, single
forever, which means that...

2239
01:40:32,327 --> 01:40:34,794
Forgive me, but this does

2240
01:40:34,796 --> 01:40:37,363
keep me up
in the middle of the night.

2241
01:40:37,365 --> 01:40:38,498
Oh.

2242
01:40:38,500 --> 01:40:39,999
What?

2243
01:40:40,001 --> 01:40:42,668
That I don't want to
be buried alone.

2244
01:40:42,670 --> 01:40:43,903
Paige'll be
with her husband,

2245
01:40:43,905 --> 01:40:45,304
and Matt'll be
with his new family,

2246
01:40:45,306 --> 01:40:47,073
and I will be
buried with strangers.

2247
01:40:47,075 --> 01:40:50,910
I will buried in the strangers
singles section of the cemetery.

2248
01:40:50,912 --> 01:40:54,180
Not that that is a reason
to stay together.

2249
01:40:54,182 --> 01:40:57,550
But it's just, you know,
a scary sidebar.

2250
01:40:57,552 --> 01:41:00,486
Let's take that one
off your plate right now.

2251
01:41:00,488 --> 01:41:02,355
You can be buried with
me and Molly.

2252
01:41:02,357 --> 01:41:04,424
I happen to have space,
okay?

2253
01:41:04,426 --> 01:41:07,093
Oh.

2254
01:41:07,095 --> 01:41:10,730
Thank you so much.
That is...

2255
01:41:10,732 --> 01:41:13,099
And to think
i didn't even want to hire you.

2256
01:41:13,101 --> 01:41:15,435
The one time
i don't have my hanky.

2257
01:41:22,376 --> 01:41:25,745
You want to...

2258
01:41:25,747 --> 01:41:28,114
Watch TV?

2259
01:41:28,116 --> 01:41:29,916
Just for
a few minutes?

2260
01:41:29,918 --> 01:41:31,617
Yeah, sure, I would.

2261
01:41:36,124 --> 01:41:37,757
Woman:<i> Even though</i>
<i> the planned merger has...</i>

2262
01:43:26,533 --> 01:43:27,967
Airport, please.

2263
01:43:39,179 --> 01:43:41,881
So, did we like him?

2264
01:43:41,883 --> 01:43:44,817
He said
all the right things.

2265
01:43:44,819 --> 01:43:48,187
He said that no one knows
about the fit like me.

2266
01:43:48,189 --> 01:43:51,891
That he doesn't want to remove
the soul of the company.

2267
01:43:51,893 --> 01:43:53,859
He said that
he doesn't have a plan.

2268
01:43:53,861 --> 01:43:56,896
He wants to watch us
and see what works.

2269
01:43:56,898 --> 01:44:01,067
He was polite and respectful
and super smart.

2270
01:44:02,336 --> 01:44:03,970
And I hired him.

2271
01:44:05,706 --> 01:44:06,906
Seriously?

2272
01:44:06,908 --> 01:44:08,541
Yeah.

2273
01:44:08,543 --> 01:44:10,176
You did it
right in the room?

2274
01:44:10,178 --> 01:44:12,578
He told me to sleep on it
and that we'd talk tomorrow,

2275
01:44:12,580 --> 01:44:15,581
but I said
the job was his.

2276
01:44:15,583 --> 01:44:18,417
We shook hands on it.

2277
01:44:18,419 --> 01:44:23,289
You know if, uh, we disagree,
he's the tiebreaker?

2278
01:44:23,291 --> 01:44:25,791
Of course.
He's the ceo.

2279
01:44:25,793 --> 01:44:28,828
Yeah. Duh.

2280
01:44:44,811 --> 01:44:45,945
Hi.

2281
01:44:45,947 --> 01:44:47,680
Hey!

2282
01:44:52,653 --> 01:44:53,919
You smell minty.

2283
01:44:53,921 --> 01:44:55,821
I just made mint tea.

2284
01:44:55,823 --> 01:44:58,557
So...

2285
01:44:58,559 --> 01:45:00,693
Yes? No?

2286
01:45:02,095 --> 01:45:03,462
I did it.

2287
01:45:03,464 --> 01:45:05,264
I liked him.
A lot.

2288
01:45:05,266 --> 01:45:08,167
And, uh...
I offered him the job.

2289
01:45:08,169 --> 01:45:10,303
Wow. Really?

2290
01:45:10,305 --> 01:45:12,338
Yeah.

2291
01:45:12,340 --> 01:45:14,674
And you're okay
with it?

2292
01:45:14,676 --> 01:45:16,842
Yeah.

2293
01:45:16,844 --> 01:45:19,178
I think
it'll be good for us.

2294
01:45:27,155 --> 01:45:31,924
Do we have any, like, real
booze, like vodka or something?

2295
01:45:31,926 --> 01:45:33,326
Yeah.

2296
01:45:42,836 --> 01:45:46,272
Did "good for us"
mean...

2297
01:45:46,274 --> 01:45:48,040
About the fit...

2298
01:45:48,042 --> 01:45:51,377
Or us?

2299
01:45:51,379 --> 01:45:53,512
You-and-me us.

2300
01:45:56,683 --> 01:45:59,218
I figure if someone else can
call some of the shots at work,

2301
01:45:59,220 --> 01:46:01,287
then maybe...

2302
01:46:01,289 --> 01:46:03,856
We can get back to
where we were 18 months ago.

2303
01:46:05,392 --> 01:46:07,560
They say you can't put the genie
back in the bottle,

2304
01:46:07,562 --> 01:46:09,695
but we can try, right?

2305
01:47:26,406 --> 01:47:27,706
Hey!

2306
01:47:27,708 --> 01:47:29,041
Hi.

2307
01:47:29,043 --> 01:47:30,609
Wait, you live here?

2308
01:47:30,611 --> 01:47:32,912
Yeah, Ben's been putting me up
until I can find a place.

2309
01:47:32,914 --> 01:47:34,647
Oh, should I let him know
that you're here?

2310
01:47:34,649 --> 01:47:36,081
That's okay.
I'll ring.

2311
01:47:36,083 --> 01:47:37,616
Okay.

2312
01:47:43,290 --> 01:47:44,623
Fiona?!

2313
01:47:44,625 --> 01:47:46,091
Jules!

2314
01:47:46,093 --> 01:47:47,359
Come on in.

2315
01:47:50,764 --> 01:47:52,965
I'm just on my way
to work.

2316
01:47:52,967 --> 01:47:54,900
Ben's right in here.

2317
01:48:01,675 --> 01:48:03,509
I'll let you two talk.

2318
01:48:06,413 --> 01:48:07,847
-See you.
-Mm-hmm.

2319
01:48:07,849 --> 01:48:09,648
Hi.

2320
01:48:09,650 --> 01:48:11,116
Wow.

2321
01:48:11,118 --> 01:48:13,085
You and Fiona, huh?
Who knew.

2322
01:48:13,087 --> 01:48:14,787
She's a great gal.

2323
01:48:14,789 --> 01:48:18,190
She surprised me last night.
She brought over dinner.

2324
01:48:18,192 --> 01:48:19,925
It's brand-new.

2325
01:48:19,927 --> 01:48:22,995
Congratulations.
I love her.

2326
01:48:22,997 --> 01:48:24,897
Yeah.

2327
01:48:30,471 --> 01:48:33,506
So, I was ready kind of early
this morning, since about 4:00,

2328
01:48:33,508 --> 01:48:35,841
and Matt and Paige left an hour
ago for a field trip

2329
01:48:35,843 --> 01:48:37,676
so I thought I'd come by.
I hope that's okay.

2330
01:48:37,678 --> 01:48:39,378
Yeah.

2331
01:48:41,549 --> 01:48:44,450
I just wanted to say...

2332
01:48:44,452 --> 01:48:47,052
I slept on it.

2333
01:48:47,054 --> 01:48:49,989
I haven't called townsend
yet, but...

2334
01:48:49,991 --> 01:48:53,058
I still feel like
it's the right thing to do.

2335
01:48:55,629 --> 01:48:58,163
Well...

2336
01:48:58,165 --> 01:49:01,033
I didn't
sleep so well myself.

2337
01:49:01,035 --> 01:49:02,701
Over this?

2338
01:49:02,703 --> 01:49:04,870
You remember the day
i drove you to the warehouse?

2339
01:49:04,872 --> 01:49:06,872
You were giving me the
wrong directions and all that?

2340
01:49:06,874 --> 01:49:08,140
Yeah. I remember.

2341
01:49:09,476 --> 01:49:11,010
Okay, well,
i stood in the back,

2342
01:49:11,012 --> 01:49:12,411
and I watched you
show the workers

2343
01:49:12,413 --> 01:49:14,713
how to fold
and box the clothes.

2344
01:49:14,715 --> 01:49:18,083
I knew then
that was why atf was a success.

2345
01:49:18,085 --> 01:49:19,518
No one else
is ever gonna have

2346
01:49:19,520 --> 01:49:22,588
that kind of commitment
to your company, Jules.

2347
01:49:22,590 --> 01:49:25,224
To me,
it's pretty simple.

2348
01:49:25,226 --> 01:49:27,660
About the fit needs you,
and if you don't mind me saying,

2349
01:49:27,662 --> 01:49:29,194
you need it.

2350
01:49:29,196 --> 01:49:31,497
Someone may come in
with more experience than you,

2351
01:49:31,499 --> 01:49:34,433
but they're never gonna know
what you know.

2352
01:49:34,435 --> 01:49:36,602
I never had anything like this
in my life.

2353
01:49:36,604 --> 01:49:38,571
Not many people do.

2354
01:49:38,573 --> 01:49:42,274
This big, beautiful,
exciting thing that you created.

2355
01:49:42,276 --> 01:49:44,743
It's a dream,
isn't it?

2356
01:49:44,745 --> 01:49:46,378
And you're gonna
give that up

2357
01:49:46,380 --> 01:49:49,715
in the hopes that your husband
will stop having an affair?

2358
01:49:49,717 --> 01:49:52,418
I don't see
how that adds up.

2359
01:49:52,420 --> 01:49:55,554
You should feel nothing but
great about what you've done.

2360
01:49:55,556 --> 01:49:58,958
And I'd hate to see you let
anyone take that away from you.

2361
01:50:04,764 --> 01:50:06,098
I guess
you came over here

2362
01:50:06,100 --> 01:50:08,801
because you wanted to hear
some of this.

2363
01:50:08,803 --> 01:50:10,569
Yes.

2364
01:50:10,571 --> 01:50:13,205
And maybe also
because you're my...

2365
01:50:13,207 --> 01:50:14,506
Intern.

2366
01:50:16,142 --> 01:50:20,613
Well, I was gonna say
intern/best friend.

2367
01:50:22,082 --> 01:50:24,483
But there's no need to get
all sentimental about it

2368
01:50:24,485 --> 01:50:27,219
even though we could potentially
be buried together.

2369
01:50:27,221 --> 01:50:28,988
Can't get closer
than that.

2370
01:50:32,926 --> 01:50:34,326
It's moments like this
when you need

2371
01:50:34,328 --> 01:50:36,128
someone you know
you can count on.

2372
01:50:36,130 --> 01:50:37,529
So thank you.

2373
01:50:40,667 --> 01:50:43,068
I like your house
so much by the way.

2374
01:50:43,070 --> 01:50:44,903
Thanks.

2375
01:50:49,409 --> 01:50:51,210
So?

2376
01:51:06,326 --> 01:51:08,127
Shall we?

2377
01:51:08,129 --> 01:51:09,862
Okay.

2378
01:51:15,669 --> 01:51:17,970
Welcome back,
you two.

2379
01:51:17,972 --> 01:51:19,838
Jules, I have something cool
to show you.

2380
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:21,707
Do you remember taking
a customer-service call

2381
01:51:21,709 --> 01:51:24,476
about a bride whose bridesmaids'
dresses showed up in gray,

2382
01:51:24,478 --> 01:51:25,811
and we had the vendor
remake them overnight

2383
01:51:25,813 --> 01:51:27,046
and put them on a plane?

2384
01:51:27,048 --> 01:51:28,814
Yeah. Yeah.
Rachel.

2385
01:51:28,816 --> 01:51:30,482
Check this out.

2386
01:51:32,453 --> 01:51:34,386
The silk chiffon
antoinette dress.

2387
01:51:34,388 --> 01:51:36,889
They look beautiful.

2388
01:51:36,891 --> 01:51:39,858
Oh, and these just arrived
from mark townsend.

2389
01:51:42,162 --> 01:51:43,629
-Here.
-Thanks.

2390
01:51:54,207 --> 01:51:56,141
Becky? Give me townsend's
number, will you?

2391
01:51:56,143 --> 01:51:58,077
Becky: Okay.

2392
01:52:00,214 --> 01:52:01,714
This is Jules.

2393
01:52:01,716 --> 01:52:03,849
Hey, Alonzo, what's up?

2394
01:52:03,851 --> 01:52:05,350
Uh-huh. Okay.

2395
01:52:05,352 --> 01:52:07,953
Do we need that many?

2396
01:52:13,693 --> 01:52:15,694
Matt:
I hope I'm not too late.

2397
01:52:15,696 --> 01:52:17,429
Don't do this for me,
Jules.

2398
01:52:17,431 --> 01:52:18,597
Please?

2399
01:52:18,599 --> 01:52:20,566
Just do what feels right
for you.

2400
01:52:20,568 --> 01:52:22,501
Oh, my god.

2401
01:52:25,171 --> 01:52:28,173
I want to continue running
my company, Matt.

2402
01:52:28,175 --> 01:52:29,708
You got to know that.

2403
01:52:29,710 --> 01:52:32,444
Then do it.
I don't want you to be unhappy.

2404
01:52:32,446 --> 01:52:35,013
I'm already unhappy.

2405
01:52:37,617 --> 01:52:39,084
I need to
tell you something.

2406
01:52:39,086 --> 01:52:40,786
I know.

2407
01:52:41,888 --> 01:52:43,956
Just tell me,
is it almost over?

2408
01:52:43,958 --> 01:52:45,891
I don't know
how much longer I can --

2409
01:52:45,893 --> 01:52:48,193
it's over.

2410
01:52:48,195 --> 01:52:53,232
I can't tell you
how s-sorry and ashamed I am.

2411
01:52:53,234 --> 01:52:56,135
I thought
i could do it.

2412
01:52:56,137 --> 01:52:58,237
I thought I could be
the guy that I told you

2413
01:52:58,239 --> 01:53:00,539
I was going to be.

2414
01:53:00,541 --> 01:53:03,809
And then
somewhere along the way...

2415
01:53:05,779 --> 01:53:07,613
...i thought
i was losing you.

2416
01:53:09,883 --> 01:53:13,285
But it was actually me.

2417
01:53:13,287 --> 01:53:15,254
I got lost.

2418
01:53:15,256 --> 01:53:17,156
It's a confusing world
out there,

2419
01:53:17,158 --> 01:53:20,159
and who I am
got messed up for a minute.

2420
01:53:20,161 --> 01:53:25,964
And now I'm watching you ready
to give all this up for me.

2421
01:53:25,966 --> 01:53:29,301
I will not
let that happen.

2422
01:53:29,303 --> 01:53:34,239
I love you, and I will do so
much better if you'll let me.

2423
01:53:39,946 --> 01:53:41,847
Please, Jules.

2424
01:53:41,849 --> 01:53:45,384
Let me
make it right again.

2425
01:53:55,161 --> 01:53:57,196
You know
what would be good?

2426
01:53:58,698 --> 01:54:00,833
If you carried
a handkerchief.

2427
01:54:15,348 --> 01:54:18,116
Have you
called townsend yet?

2428
01:54:18,118 --> 01:54:20,652
Because if I've ever met anyone
who doesn't need a boss,

2429
01:54:20,654 --> 01:54:22,287
it was you.

2430
01:54:24,157 --> 01:54:27,292
I was just about to call him
and tell him I changed my mind.

2431
01:54:28,895 --> 01:54:30,863
I mean,
we're good here.

2432
01:54:30,865 --> 01:54:33,165
We're gonna make it.

2433
01:54:33,167 --> 01:54:34,633
I'm gonna make sure
we make it.

2434
01:54:34,635 --> 01:54:36,301
Good.

2435
01:54:59,058 --> 01:55:00,492
Becky.

2436
01:55:00,494 --> 01:55:02,027
Where's Ben?

2437
01:55:02,029 --> 01:55:05,397
I'm not sure. He said
he was taking the day off.

2438
01:55:10,204 --> 01:55:12,104
Fiona.

2439
01:55:12,106 --> 01:55:13,772
Do you know
where Ben is?

2440
01:55:46,606 --> 01:55:48,106
I'm so sorry
to interrupt.

2441
01:55:48,108 --> 01:55:50,642
That's okay.

2442
01:55:50,644 --> 01:55:53,478
Extend your left arm,
Jules.

2443
01:55:53,480 --> 01:55:56,281
Left knee up...

2444
01:55:56,283 --> 01:56:00,319
Breathe and relax
for inner balance.

2445
01:56:00,321 --> 01:56:03,055
-Am I doing it right?
-Almost.

2446
01:56:03,057 --> 01:56:04,589
Got something good
to tell you.

2447
01:56:04,591 --> 01:56:06,491
Great.
Tell me when we're done.

2448
01:56:10,163 --> 01:56:12,898
Breathe deeply, Jules.

2449
01:56:18,004 --> 01:56:20,172
That's it, out there.

2450
01:56:20,174 --> 01:56:22,474
This up.
